The modern fanciful story is here placed next to the real folk story instead of after all the groups of folk products. The Hebrew stories at the beginning belong quite as well, perhaps even better, in Section V, while the stories at the end of Section VI shade off into the more modern types of short tales. Then the fact that other groups of modern stories are to follow later, illustrating more realistic studies of life and the very recent and remarkably numerous writings centering around animal life, limits the list here. Many of the animal stories might, with equal propriety, be placed under the head of the fantastic.\\n\\nThe child\\'s natural literature. The world has lost certain secrets as the price of an advancing civilization. It is a commonplace of observation that no one can duplicate the success of Mother Goose, whether she be thought of as the maker of jingles or the teller of tales. The conditions of modern life preclude the generally naïve attitude that produced the folk rhymes, ballads, tales, proverbs, fables, and myths. The folk saw things simply and directly. The complex, analytic, questioning mind is not yet, either in or out of stories. The motives from which people act are to them plain and not mixed. Characters are good or bad. They feel no need of elaborately explaining their joys and sorrows. Such experiences come with the day\\'s work. \"To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.\" The zest of life with them is emphatic. Their humor is fresh, unbounded, sincere; there is no trace of cynicism. In folk literature we do not feel the presence of a \"writer\" who is mightily concerned about maintaining his reputation for wisdom, originality, or style. Hence the freedom from any note of straining after effect, of artificiality. In the midst of a life limited to fundamental needs, their literature deals with fundamentals. On the whole, it was a literature for entertainment. A more learned upper class may have concerned itself then about \"problems\" and \"purposes,\" as the whole world does now, but the literature of the folk had no such interests.\\n\\nWithout discussing the limits of the culture-epoch theory of human development as a complete guide in education, it is clear that the young child passes through a period when his mind looks out upon the world in a manner analogous to that of the folk as expressed in their literature. Quarrel with the fact as we may, it still remains a fact that his nature craves these old stories and will not be satisfied with something \"just as good.\"\\n\\nThe modern fairy story. The advance of civilization has been accompanied by a wistful longing for the simplicities left by the way. In some periods this interest in the past has been more marked than in others. When the machinery of life has weighed too heavily on the human spirit, men have turned for relief to a contemplation of the \"good old times\" and have preached crusades of a \"return to nature.\" 172 Many modern writers have tried to recapture some of the power of the folk tale by imitating its method. In many cases they have had a fair degree of success: in one case, that of Hans Christian Andersen, the success is admittedly very complete. As a rule, however, the sharpness of the sense of wonder has been blunted, and many imitators of the old fairy tale succeed in keeping only the shell. Another class of modern fantastic tale is that of the pourquoi story, which has the explanation of something as its object. Such tales grow out of the attempt to use the charm of old stories as a means of conveying instruction, somewhat after the method of those parents who covered up our bitter medicine with some of our favorite jam. Even \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" as we saw, has been turned into a flower myth. So compelling is this pedagogical motive that so-called nature myths have been invented or made from existing stories in great numbers. The practical results please many teachers, but it may be questioned whether the gain is sufficient to compensate children for the distorting results upon masterpieces.\\n\\nWide range of the modern fairy tale. The bibliography will suggest something of the treasures in the field of the modern fanciful story. From the delightful nonsense of Alice in Wonderland and the \"travelers\\' tales\" of Baron Munchausen to the profound seriousness of The King of the Golden River and Why the Chimes Rang is a far cry. There are the rich fancies of Barrie and Maeterlinck, at the same time delicate as the promises of spring and brilliant as the fruitions of summer. One may be blown away to the land of Oz, he may lose his shadow with Peter Schlemihl, he may outdo the magic carpet with his Traveling-Cloak, he may visit the courts of kings with his Wonderful Chair; Miss Muffet will invite us to her Christmas party, Lemuel Gulliver will lead us to lands not marked in the school atlas; on every side is a world of wonder.\\n\\nSome qualities of these modern tales. Every age produces after its own fashion, and we must expect to find the modern user of the fairy-story method expressing through it the qualities of his own outlook upon the world. Interest in the picturesque aspects of landscape will be emphasized, as in the early portions of \"The Story of Fairyfoot\" and, with especial magnificence of style, throughout The King of the Golden River. There will appear the saddened mood of the modern in the face of the human miseries that make happiness a mockery, as in \"The Happy Prince.\" The destructive effects of the possessive instinct upon all that is finest in human nature is reflected in \"The Prince\\'s Dream.\" That the most valuable efforts are often those performed with least spectacular settings may be discerned in \"The Knights of the Silver Shield,\" while the lesson of kindly helpfulness is the burden of \"Old Pipes and the Dryad.\" In many modern stories the reader is too much aware of the conscious efforts of style and structure. The thoughtful child will sometimes be too much distressed by the more somber modern story, and should not hear too many of the gloomy type.\\n\\nAndersen the consummate master. Hans Christian Andersen is the acknowledged master of the modern story for children. What are the sources of his success? Genius is always unexplainable except in terms of itself, but some things are clear. To begin, he makes a mark—drives down a peg: \"There came a soldier marching along 173 the high road—one, two! one, two!\" and you are off. No backing and filling, no jockeying for position, no elaborate setting of the stage. The story\\'s the thing! Next, the language is the language of common oral speech, free and unrestrained. The rigid forms of the grammar are eschewed. There is no beating around the bush. Seeing through the eyes of the child, he uses the language that is natural to such sight: \"Aha! there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.\" In quick dramatic fashion the story unrolls before your vision: \"So the soldier cut the witch\\'s head off. There she lay!\" No agonizing over the cruelty of it, the lack of sympathy. It is a joke after the child\\'s own heart, and with a hearty laugh at this end to an impostor, the listener is on with the story. The logic is the logic of childhood: \"And everyone could see she was a real princess, for she was so lovely.\" When Andersen deals with some of the deeper truths of existence, as in \"The Nightingale\" or \"The Ugly Duckling,\" he still manages to throw it all into the form that is natural and convincing and simple to the child. He never mounts a pedestal and becomes a grown-up philosopher. Perhaps Andersen\\'s secret lay in the fact that some fairy godmother invested him at birth with a power to see things so completely as a child sees them that he never questioned the dignity of the method. In few of his stories is there any evidence of a constraint due to a conscious attempt to write down to the understandings of children.\\n\\nSUGGESTIONS FOR READING\\n\\nThe most valuable discussion of the difficulties to be mastered in writing the literary fairy tale, and the story of the only very complete mastery yet made, will be found in the account of Hans Christian Andersen in Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century, by Georg Brandes. Now and then hints of importance on such stories and their value for children may be found in biographies of the more prominent writers represented in the section and mentioned in the bibliography, and in magazine articles and reviews. These latter may be located by use of the periodical indexes found in most libraries. For the proper attitude which the schools should have toward fiction and fanciful writing in general, nothing could be better than two lectures on \"Children\\'s Reading,\" in On the Art of Reading, by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch.\\n\\n174\\n\\n190\\n\\nThe rabbis of old were good story-tellers. They were essentially teachers and they understood that the best sermon is a story. \"They were fond of the parable, the anecdote, the apt illustration, and their legends that have been transmitted to us, all aglow with the light and life of the Orient, possess perennial charm.\" It is possible to find in rabbinical sources a large number of brief stories that have the power of entertaining as well as of emphasizing some qualities of character that are important in all ages. The plan of this book does not include the wonderful stories of the Old Testament, which are easy of access to any teacher and may be used as experience directs. The Hebrew stories following correspond very nearly to the folk anecdote and are placed in this section because of their literary form.\\n\\nDr. Abram S. Isaacs (1851—) is a professor in New York University and is also a rabbi. The selection that follows is from his Stories from the Rabbis. (Copyrighted. Used by special permission of The Bloch Publishing Company, New York.) Taking advantage of the popular superstition that a four-leaved clover is a sign of good luck, Dr. Isaacs has grouped together four parable-like stories, each of which deals with wealth as a subject. The editors are responsible for the special titles given. The messages of these stories might be summarized as follows: If you would be lucky, (1) be honest because it is right to be honest, (2) value good friends more highly than gold, (3) let love accompany each gift of charity, and (4) use common sense in your business ventures.\\n\\nA FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER\\n\\nABRAM S. ISAACS\\n\\n1. The Rabbi and The Diadem\\n\\nGreat was the alarm in the palace of Rome, which soon spread throughout the entire city. The Empress had lost her costly diadem, and it could not be found. They searched in every direction, but it was all in vain. Half distracted, for the mishap boded no good to her or her house, the Empress redoubled her exertions to regain her precious possession, but without result. As a last resource it was proclaimed in the public streets:\\n\\n\"The Empress has lost a priceless diadem. Whoever restores it within thirty days shall receive a princely reward. But he who delays, and brings it after thirty days, shall lose his head.\"\\n\\nIn those times all nationalities flocked toward Rome; all classes and creeds could be met in its stately halls and crowded thoroughfares. Among the rest was a rabbi, a learnèd sage from the East, who loved goodness and lived a righteous life, in the stir and turmoil of the Western world. It chanced one night as he was strolling up and down, in busy meditation, beneath the clear, moonlit sky, he saw the diadem sparkling at his feet. He seized it quickly, brought it to his dwelling, where he guarded it carefully until the thirty days had expired, when he resolved to return it to the owner.\\n\\nHe proceeded to the palace, and, undismayed at sight of long lines of soldiery and officials, asked for an audience with the Empress.\\n\\n\"What dost thou mean by this?\" she inquired, when he told her his story and gave her the diadem. \"Why didst thou delay until this hour? Dost thou know the penalty? Thy head must be forfeited.\"\\n\\n\"I delayed until now,\" the rabbi answered calmly, \"so that thou mightst know that I return thy diadem, not for the sake of the reward, still less out of fear of punishment; but solely to comply 175 with the Divine command not to withhold from another the property which belongs to him.\"\\n\\n\"Blessed be thy God!\" the Empress answered, and dismissed the rabbi without further reproof; for had he not done right for right\\'s sake?\\n\\n2. Friendship\\n\\nA certain father was doubly blessed—he had reached a good old age, and had ten sons. One day he called them to his side, and after repeated expressions of affection, told them that he had acquired a fortune by industry and economy, and would give them one hundred gold pieces each before his death, so that they might begin business for themselves, and not be obliged to wait until he had passed away. It happened, however, that, soon after, he lost a portion of his property, much to his regret, and had only nine hundred and fifty gold pieces left. So he gave one hundred to each of his nine sons. When his youngest son, whom he loved most of all, asked naturally what was to be his share, the father replied:\\n\\n\"My son, I promised to give each of thy brothers one hundred gold pieces. I shall keep my word to them. I have fifty left. Thirty I shall reserve for my funeral expenses, and twenty will be thy portion. But understand this—I possess, in addition, ten friends, whom I give over to thee as compensation for the loss of the eighty gold pieces. Believe me, they are worth more than all the gold and silver.\"\\n\\nThe youth tenderly embraced his parent, and assured him that he was content, such was his confidence and affection. In a few days the father died, and the nine sons took their money, and without a thought of their youngest brother and the small amount he had received, followed each his own fancy. But the youngest son, although his portion was the least, resolved to heed his father\\'s words, and hold fast to the ten friends. When a short time had elapsed he prepared a simple feast, went to the ten friends of his father, and said to them: \"My father, almost in his last words, asked me to keep you, his friends, in honor. Before I leave this place to seek my fortune elsewhere, will you not share with me a farewell meal, and aid me thus to comply with his dying request?\"\\n\\nThe ten friends, stirred by his earnestness and cordiality, accepted his invitation with pleasure, and enjoyed the repast, although they were used to richer fare. When the moment for parting arrived, however, one of them rose and spoke: \"My friends, it seems to me that of all the sons of our dear friend that has gone, the youngest alone is mindful of his father\\'s friendship for us, and reverences his memory. Let us, then, be true friends to him, for his own sake as well, and provide for him a generous sum, that he may begin business here, and not be forced to live among strangers.\"\\n\\nThe proposal, so unexpected and yet so merited, was received with applause. The youth, proud of their friendship, soon became a prosperous merchant, who never forgot that faithful friends were more valuable than gold or silver, and left an honored name to his descendants.\\n\\n3. True Charity\\n\\nThere lived once a very wealthy man, who cared little for money, except as 176 a means for helping others. He used to adopt a peculiar plan in his method of charitable relief. He had three boxes made for the three different classes of people whom he desired to assist. In one box he put gold pieces, which he distributed among artists and scholars, for he honored knowledge and learning as the highest possession. In the second box he placed silver pieces for widows and orphans, for whom his sympathies were readily awakened. In the third were copper coins for the general poor and beggars—no one was turned away from his dwelling without some gift, however small.\\n\\nThat the man was beloved by all, need hardly be said. He rejoiced that he was enabled to do so much good, retained his modest bearing, and continued to regard his wealth as only an incentive to promote the happiness of mankind, without distinction of creed or nationality. Unhappily, his wife was just the opposite. She rarely gave food or raiment to the poor, and felt angry at her husband\\'s liberality, which she considered shameless extravagance.\\n\\nThe day came when in the pressure of various duties he had to leave his house, and could not return until the morrow. Unaware of his sudden departure, the poor knocked at the door as usual for his kind gifts; but when they found him absent, they were about to go away or remain in the street, being terrified at the thought of asking his wife for alms. Vexed at their conduct, she exclaimed impetuously: \"I will give to the poor according to my husband\\'s method.\"\\n\\nShe seized the keys of the boxes, and first opened the box of gold. But how great was her terror when she gazed at its contents—frogs jumping here and there. Then she went to the silver box, and it was full of ants. With troubled heart, she opened the copper box, and it was crowded with creeping bugs. Loud then were her complaints, and bitter her tears, at the deception, and she kept her room until her husband returned.\\n\\nNo sooner did the man enter the room, annoyed that so many poor people were kept waiting outside, than she asked him: \"Why did you give me keys to boxes of frogs, ants, and bugs, instead of gold, silver, and copper? Was it right thus to deceive your wife, and disappoint the poor?\"\\n\\n\"Not so,\" rejoined her husband. \"The mistake must be yours, not mine. I have given you the right keys. I do not know what you have done with them. Come, let me have them. I am guiltless of any deception.\" He took the keys, quickly opened the boxes, and found the coins as he had left them. \"Ah, dear wife,\" said he, when she had regained her composure, \"your heart, I fear, was not in the gift, when you wished to give to the poor. It is the feeling that prompts us to aid, not the mere money, which is the chief thing after all.\"\\n\\nAnd ever after, her heart was changed. Her gifts blessed the poor of the land, and aroused their love and reverence.\\n\\n4. An Eastern Garden\\n\\nIn an Eastern city a lovely garden flourished, whose beauty and luxuriance awakened much admiration. It was the owner\\'s greatest pleasure to watch its growth, as leaf, flower, and tree seemed daily to unfold to brighter bloom. One morning, while taking his usual stroll through the well-kept paths, 177 he was surprised to find that some blossoms were picked to pieces. The next day he noticed more signs of mischief, and rendered thus more observant he gave himself no rest until he had discovered the culprit. It was a little trembling bird, whom he managed to capture, and was about to kill in his anger, when it exclaimed: \"Do not kill me, I beg you, kind sir. I am only a wee, tiny bird. My flesh is too little to satisfy you. I would not furnish one-hundredth of a meal to a man of your size. Let me free without any hesitation, and I shall teach you something that will be of much use to you and your friends.\"\\n\\n\"I would dearly like to put an end to you,\" replied the man, \"for you were rapidly putting an end to my garden. It is a good thing to rid the world of such annoyances. But as I am not revengeful, and am always glad to learn something useful, I shall set you free this time.\" And he opened his hand to give the bird more air.\\n\\n\"Attention!\" cried the bird. \"Here are three rules which should guide you through life, and if you observe them you will find your path made easier: Do not cry over spilt milk; do not desire what is unattainable, and do not believe what is impossible.\"\\n\\nThe man was satisfied with the advice, and let the bird escape; but it had scarcely regained its liberty, when, from a high tree opposite, it exclaimed:\\n\\n\"What a silly man! The idea of letting me escape! If you only knew what you have lost! But it is too late now.\"\\n\\n\"What have I lost?\" the man asked, angrily.\\n\\n\"Why, if you had killed me, as you intended, you would have found inside of me a huge pearl, as large as a goose\\'s egg, and you would have been a wealthy man forever.\"\\n\\n\"Dear little bird,\" the man said in his blandest tones; \"sweet little bird, I will not harm you. Only come down to me, and I will treat you as if you were my own child, and give you fruit and flowers all day. I assure you of this most sacredly.\"\\n\\nBut the bird shook its head sagely, and replied: \"What a silly man, to forget so soon the advice which was given him in all seriousness. I told you not to cry over spilt milk, and here you are, worrying over what has happened. I urged you not to desire the unattainable, and now you wish to capture me again. And, finally, I asked you not to believe what is impossible, and you are rashly imagining that I have a huge pearl inside of me, when a goose\\'s egg is larger than my whole body. You ought to learn your lessons better in the future, if you would become wise,\" added the bird, as with another twist of its head it flew away, and was lost in the distance.\\n\\n191\\n\\nA classic collection of short stories from the ancient Hebrew sages is the little book, Hebrew Tales, published in London in 1826 by the noted Jewish scholar Hyman Hurwitz (1770-1844). A modern handy edition of this book (about sixty tales) is published as Vol. II of the Library of Jewish Classics. Of special interest is the fact that it contained three stories by the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who had published them first in his periodical, The Friend. Coleridge was much interested in Hebrew literature, and especially fond of speaking in parables, as those who know \"The Ancient Mariner\" will readily recall. The 178 following is one of the three stories referred to, and it had prefixed to it the significant text, \"The Lord helpeth man and beast.\" (Psalm XXXVI, 6.)\\n\\nTHE LORD HELPETH MAN AND BEAST\\n\\nSAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE\\n\\nDuring his march to conquer the world, Alexander, the Macedonian, came to a people in Africa who dwelt in a remote and secluded corner, in peaceful huts, and knew neither war nor conqueror. They led him to the hut of their chief, who received him hospitably, and placed before him golden dates, golden figs, and bread of gold.\\n\\n\"Do you eat gold in this country?\" said Alexander.\\n\\n\"I take it for granted,\" replied the chief, \"that thou wert able to find eatable food in thine own country. For what reason, then, art thou come amongst us?\"\\n\\n\"Your gold has not tempted me hither,\" said Alexander, \"but I would become acquainted with your manners and customs.\"\\n\\n\"So be it,\" rejoined the other: \"sojourn among us as long as it pleaseth thee.\"\\n\\nAt the close of this conversation, two citizens entered, as into their court of justice. The plaintiff said, \"I bought of this man a piece of land, and as I was making a deep drain through it, I found a treasure. This is not mine, for I only bargained for the land, and not for any treasure that might be concealed beneath it; and yet the former owner of the land will not receive it.\" The defendant answered, \"I hope I have a conscience, as well as my fellow citizen. I sold him the land with all its contingent, as well as existing advantages, and consequently, the treasure inclusively.\"\\n\\nThe chief, who was at the same time their supreme judge, recapitulated their words, in order that the parties might see whether or not he understood them aright. Then, after some reflection, said: \"Thou hast a son, friend, I believe?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"And thou,\" addressing the other, \"a daughter?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, let thy son marry thy daughter, and bestow the treasure on the young couple for a marriage portion.\" Alexander seemed surprised and perplexed. \"Think you my sentence unjust?\" the chief asked him.\\n\\n\"Oh, no!\" replied Alexander; \"but it astonishes me.\"\\n\\n\"And how, then,\" rejoined the chief, \"would the case have been decided in your country?\"\\n\\n\"To confess the truth,\" said Alexander, \"we should have taken both parties into custody, and have seized the treasure for the king\\'s use.\"\\n\\n\"For the king\\'s use!\" exclaimed the chief; \"does the sun shine on that country?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\"\\n\\n\"Does it rain there?\"\\n\\n\"Assuredly.\"\\n\\n\"Wonderful! But are there tame animals in the country, that live on the grass and green herbs?\"\\n\\n\"Very many, and of many kinds.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, that must, then, be the cause,\" said the chief: \"for the sake of those innocent animals the All-gracious Being continues to let the sun shine, and the rain drop down on your country; since its inhabitants are unworthy of such blessings.\" 179\\n\\n192\\n\\nBy almost common consent Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), the Danish author, is the acknowledged master of all modern writers of fairy tales. He was born in poverty, the son of a poor shoemaker. With a naturally keen dramatic sense, his imagination was stirred by stories from the Arabian Nights and La Fontaine\\'s Fables, by French and Spanish soldiers marching through his native city, and by listening to the wonderful folk tales of his country. On a toy stage and with toy actors, these vivid impressions took actual form. The world continued a dramatic spectacle to him throughout his existence. His consuming ambition was for the stage, but he had none of the personal graces so necessary for success. He was ungainly and awkward, like his \"ugly duckling.\" But when at last he began to write, he had the power to transfer to the page the vivid dramas in his mind, and this power culminated in the creation of fairy stories for children which he began to publish in 1835. It is usual to say that Andersen, like Peter Pan, \"never grew up,\" and it is certain that he never lost the power of seeing things as children see them. Like many great writers whose fame now rests on the suffrages of child readers, Andersen seems at first to have felt that the Tales were slight and beneath his dignity. They are not all of the same high quality. Occasionally one of them becomes \"too sentimental and sickly sweet,\" but the best of them have a sturdiness that is thoroughly refreshing.\\n\\nThe most acute analysis of the elements of Andersen\\'s greatness as the ideal writer for children is that made by his fellow-countryman Georg Brandes in Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century. A briefer account on similar lines will be found in H. J. Boyesen\\'s Scandinavian Literature. A still briefer account, eminently satisfactory for an introduction to Andersen, by Benjamin W. Wells, is in Warner\\'s Library of the World\\'s Best Literature. The interested student cannot, of course, afford to neglect Andersen\\'s own The Story of My Life. Among the more elaborate biographies the Life of Hans Christian Andersen by R. Nisbet Bain is probably the best. The first translation of the Tales into English was made by Mary Howitt in 1846 and, as far as it goes, is still regarded as one of the finest. However, Andersen has been very fortunate in his many translators. The version by H. W. Dulcken has been published in many cheap forms and perhaps more widely read than any other. In addition to the stories in the following pages, some of those most suitable for use are \"The Little Match Girl,\" \"The Silver Shilling,\" \"Five Peas in the Pod,\" \"Hans Clodhopper,\" and \"The Snow Queen.\" The latter is one of the longest and an undoubted masterpiece.\\n\\nThe first two stories following are taken from Mrs. Henderson\\'s Andersen\\'s Best Fairy Tales. (Copyright. Rand McNally & Co.) This little book contains thirteen stories in a very simple translation and also an excellent story of Andersen\\'s life in a form most attractive to children. \"The Princess and the Pea\" is a story for the story\\'s sake. The humor, perhaps slightly satirical, is based upon the notion so common in the old folk tales that royal personages are decidedly more delicate than the person of low degree. However, the tendency to think oneself of more consequence than another is not confined to any one class.\\n\\nTHE REAL PRINCESS\\n\\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN (Version by Alice Corbin Henderson)\\n\\nThere was once a Prince who wanted to marry a Princess. But it was only a real Princess that he wanted to marry.\\n\\nHe traveled all over the world to find a real one. But, although there were 180 plenty of princesses, whether they were real princesses he could never discover. There was always something that did not seem quite right about them.\\n\\nAt last he had to come home again. But he was very sad, because he wanted to marry a real Princess.\\n\\nOne night there was a terrible storm. It thundered and lightened and the rain poured down in torrents. In the middle of the storm there came a knocking, knocking, knocking at the castle gate. The kind old King himself went down to open the castle gate.\\n\\nIt was a young Princess that stood outside the gate. The wind and the rain had almost blown her to pieces. Water streamed out of her hair and out of her clothes. Water ran in at the points of her shoes and out again at the heels. Yet she said that she was a real Princess.\\n\\n\"Well, we will soon find out about that!\" thought the Queen.\\n\\nShe said nothing, but went into the bedroom, took off all the bedding, and put a small dried pea on the bottom of the bedstead. Then she piled twenty mattresses on top of the pea, and on top of these she put twenty feather beds. This was where the Princess had to sleep that night.\\n\\nIn the morning they asked her how she had slept through the night.\\n\\n\"Oh, miserably!\" said the Princess. \"I hardly closed my eyes the whole night long! Goodness only knows what was in my bed! I slept upon something so hard that I am black and blue all over. It was dreadful!\"\\n\\nSo then they knew that she was a real Princess. For, through the twenty mattresses and the twenty feather beds, she had still felt the pea. No one but a real Princess could have had such a tender skin.\\n\\nSo the Prince took her for his wife. He knew now that he had a real Princess.\\n\\nAs for the pea, it was put in a museum where it may still be seen if no one has carried it away.\\n\\nNow this is a true story!\\n\\n193\\n\\nWith some dozen exceptions, all of Andersen\\'s Tales are based upon older stories, either upon some old folk tale or upon something that he ran across in his reading. Dr. Brandes, in his Eminent Authors, shows in detail how \"The Emperor\\'s New Clothes\" came into being. \"One day in turning over the leaves of Don Manuel\\'s Count Lucanor, Andersen became charmed by the homely wisdom of the old Spanish story, with the delicate flavor of the Middle Ages pervading it, and he lingered over chapter vii, which treats of how a king was served by three rogues.\" But Andersen\\'s story is a very different one in many ways from his Spanish original. For one thing, the meaning is so universal that no one can miss it. Most of us have, in all likelihood, at some time pretended to know what we do not know or to be what we are not in order to save our face, to avoid the censure or ridicule of others. \"There is much concerning which people dare not speak the truth, through cowardice, through fear of acting otherwise than \\'all the world,\\' through anxiety lest they should appear stupid. And the story is eternally new and it never ends. It has its grave side, but just because of its endlessness it has also its humorous side.\" When the absurd bubble of the grand procession is punctured by the child, whose mental honesty has not yet been spoiled by the pressure of convention, the Emperor \"held himself stiffer than ever, and the chamberlains carried the invisible train.\" For it would never do to hold up the procession!\\n\\nTranscriber\\'s Note: original reads \\'Emporer\\'s\\'\\n\\n181\\n\\nTHE EMPEROR\\'S NEW CLOTHES\\n\\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN (Version by Alice Corbin Henderson)\\n\\nMany years ago there lived an Emperor who thought so much of new clothes that he spent all his money on them. He did not care for his soldiers; he did not care to go to the theater. He liked to drive out in the park only that he might show off his new clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day. They usually say of a king, \"He is in the council chamber.\" But of the Emperor they said, \"He is in the clothes closet!\"\\n\\nIt was a gay city in which the Emperor lived. And many strangers came to visit it every day. Among these, one day, there came two rogues who set themselves up as weavers. They said they knew how to weave the most beautiful cloths imaginable. And not only were the colors and patterns used remarkably beautiful, but clothes made from this cloth could not be seen by any one who was unfit for the office he held or was too stupid for any use.\\n\\n\"Those would be fine clothes!\" thought the Emperor. \"If I wore those I could find out what men in my empire were not fit for the places they held. I could tell the clever men from the dunces! I must have some clothes woven for me at once!\"\\n\\nSo he gave the two rogues a great deal of money that they might begin their work at once.\\n\\nThe rogues immediately put up two looms and pretended to be working. But there was nothing at all on their looms. They called for the finest silks and the brightest gold, but this they put into their pockets. At the empty looms they worked steadily until late into the night.\\n\\n\"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my clothes,\" thought the Emperor.\\n\\nBut he felt a little uneasy when he thought that any one who was stupid or was not fit for his office would be unable to see the cloth. Of course he had no fears for himself; but still he thought he would send some one else first, just to see how matters stood.\\n\\n\"I will send my faithful old Minister to the weavers,\" thought the Emperor. \"He can see how the stuff looks, for he is a clever man, and no one is so careful in fulfilling duties as he is!\"\\n\\nSo the good old Minister went into the room where the two rogues sat working at the empty looms.\\n\\n\"Mercy on us!\" thought the old Minister, opening his eyes wide, \"I can\\'t see a thing!\" But he didn\\'t care to say so.\\n\\nBoth the rascals begged him to be good enough to step a little nearer. They pointed to the empty looms and asked him if he did not think the pattern and the coloring wonderful. The poor old Minister stared and stared as hard as he could, but he could not see anything, for, of course, there was nothing to see!\\n\\n\"Mercy!\" he said to himself. \"Is it possible that I am a dunce? I never thought so! Certainly no one must know it. Am I unfit for office? It will never do to say that I cannot see the stuff!\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, why do you say nothing of it?\" asked the rogue who was pretending to weave.\\n\\n\"Oh, it is beautiful—charming!\" said the old Minister, peering through his spectacles. \"What a fine pattern, and what wonderful colors! I shall tell the Emperor that I am very much pleased with it.\" 182\\n\\n\"Well, we are glad to hear you say so,\" answered the two swindlers.\\n\\nThen they named all the colors of the invisible cloth upon the looms, and described the peculiar pattern. The old Minister listened intently, so that he could repeat all that was said of it to the Emperor.\\n\\nThe rogues now began to demand more money, more silk, and more gold thread in order to proceed with the weaving. All of this, of course, went into their pockets. Not a single strand was ever put on the empty looms at which they went on working.\\n\\nThe Emperor soon sent another faithful friend to see how soon the new clothes would be ready. But he fared no better than the Minister. He looked and looked and looked, but still saw nothing but the empty looms.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t that a pretty piece of stuff?\" asked both rogues, showing and explaining the handsome pattern which was not there at all.\\n\\n\"I am not stupid!\" thought the man. \"It must be that I am not worthy of my good position. That is, indeed, strange. But I must not let it be known!\"\\n\\nSo he praised the cloth he did not see, and expressed his approval of the color and the design that were not there. To the Emperor he said, \"It is charming!\"\\n\\nSoon everybody in town was talking about the wonderful cloth that the two rogues were weaving.\\n\\nThe Emperor began to think now that he himself would like to see the wonderful cloth while it was still on the looms. Accompanied by a number of his friends, among whom were the two faithful officers who had already beheld the imaginary stuff, he went to visit the two men who were weaving, might and main, without any fiber and without any thread.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it splendid!\" cried the two statesmen who had already been there, and who thought the others would see something upon the empty looms. \"Look, your Majesty! What colors! And what a design!\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\" thought the Emperor. \"I see nothing at all! Am I a dunce? Am I not fit to be Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen to me, if it were true.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it is very pretty!\" said the Emperor aloud. \"It has my highest approval!\"\\n\\nHe nodded his head happily, and stared at the empty looms. Never would he say that he could see nothing!\\n\\nHis friends, too, gazed and gazed, but saw no more than had the others. Yet they all cried out, \"It is beautiful!\" and advised the Emperor to wear a suit made of this cloth in a great procession that was soon to take place.\\n\\n\"It is magnificent, gorgeous!\" was the cry that went from mouth to mouth. The Emperor gave each of the rogues a royal ribbon to wear in his buttonhole, and called them the Imperial Court Weavers.\\n\\nThe rogues were up the whole night before the morning of the procession. They kept more than sixteen candles burning. The people could see them hard at work, completing the new clothes of the Emperor. They took yards of stuff down from the empty looms; they made cuts in the air with big scissors; they sewed with needles without thread; and, at last, they said, \"The clothes are ready!\"\\n\\nThe Emperor himself, with his grandest courtiers, went to put on his new suit. 183\\n\\n\"See!\" said the rogues, lifting their arms as if holding something. \"Here are the trousers! Here is the coat! Here is the cape!\" and so on. \"It is as light as a spider\\'s web. One might think one had nothing on. But that is just the beauty of it!\"\\n\\n\"Very nice,\" said the courtiers. But they could see nothing; for there was nothing!\\n\\n\"Will your Imperial Majesty be graciously pleased to take off your clothes,\" asked the rogues, \"so that we may put on the new ones before this long mirror?\"\\n\\nThe Emperor took off all his own clothes, and the two rogues pretended to put on each new garment as it was ready. They wrapped him about, and they tied and they buttoned. The Emperor turned round and round before the mirror.\\n\\n\"How well his Majesty looks in his new clothes!\" said the people. \"How becoming they are! What a pattern! What colors! It is a beautiful dress!\"\\n\\n\"They are waiting outside with the canopy which is to be carried over your Majesty in the procession,\" said the master of ceremonies.\\n\\n\"I am ready,\" said the Emperor. \"Don\\'t the clothes fit well?\" he asked, giving a last glance into the mirror as though he were looking at all his new finery.\\n\\nThe men who were to carry the train of the Emperor\\'s cloak stooped down to the floor as if picking up the train, and then held it high in the air. They did not dare let it be known that they could see nothing.\\n\\nSo the Emperor marched along under the bright canopy. Everybody in the streets and at the windows cried out: \"How beautiful the Emperor\\'s new clothes are! What a fine train! And they fit to perfection!\"\\n\\nNo one would let it be known that he could see nothing, for that would have proved that he was unfit for office or that he was very, very stupid. None of the Emperor\\'s clothes had ever been as successful as these.\\n\\n\"But he has nothing on!\" said a little child.\\n\\n\"Just listen to the innocent!\" said its father.\\n\\nBut one person whispered to another what the child had said. \"He has nothing on! A child says he has nothing on!\"\\n\\n\"But he has nothing on!\" at last cried all the people.\\n\\nThe Emperor writhed, for he knew that this was true. But he realized that it would never do to stop the procession. So he held himself stiffer than ever, and the chamberlains carried the invisible train.\\n\\n194\\n\\nIn his story \"The Nightingale,\" Andersen suggests that the so-called upper class of society may become so conventionalized as to be unable to appreciate true beauty. Poor fishermen and the little kitchen girl in the story recognize the beauty of the exquisite song of the nightingale, and Andersen shows his regard for royalty by having the emperor appreciate it twice. The last part of the story is especially impressive. When Death approached the emperor and took from him the symbols that had made him rank above his fellows, the emperor saw the realities of life and again perceived the beauty of the nightingale\\'s song. This contact with real life made Death shrink away. Then the emperor learned Andersen\\'s message to artificial society: If you would behold true beauty, you must have it in your own heart.\\n\\n184\\n\\nTHE NIGHTINGALE\\n\\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\\n\\nIn China, you must know, the Emperor is a Chinaman, and all whom he has about him are Chinamen too. It happened a good many years ago, but that\\'s just why it\\'s worth while to hear the story before it is forgotten. The Emperor\\'s palace was the most splendid in the world; it was made entirely of porcelain, very costly, but so delicate and brittle that one had to take care how one touched it. In the garden were to be seen the most wonderful flowers, and to the costliest of them silver bells were tied, which sounded, so that nobody should pass by without noticing the flowers. Yes, everything in the Emperor\\'s garden was admirably arranged. And it extended so far that the gardener himself did not know where the end was. If a man went on and on, he came into a glorious forest with high trees and deep lakes. The wood extended straight down to the sea, which was blue and deep; great ships could sail, too, beneath the branches of the trees; and in the trees lived a Nightingale, which sang so splendidly that even the poor fisherman, who had many other things to do, stopped still and listened, when he had gone out at night to throw out his nets, and heard the Nightingale.\\n\\n\"How beautiful that is!\" he said; but he was obliged to attend to his property, and thus forgot the bird. But when the next night the bird sang again, and the fisherman heard it, he exclaimed again, \"How beautiful that is!\"\\n\\nFrom all the countries of the world travelers came to the city of the Emperor, and admired it, and the palace and the garden, but when they heard the Nightingale, they said, \"That is the best of all!\"\\n\\nAnd the travelers told of it when they came home; and the learnèd men wrote many books about the town, the palace, and the garden. But they did not forget the Nightingale; that was placed highest of all; and those who were poets wrote most magnificent poems about the Nightingale in the wood by the deep lake.\\n\\nThe books went through all the world, and a few of them once came to the Emperor. He sat in his golden chair, and read, and read: every moment he nodded his head, for it pleased him to peruse the masterly descriptions of the city, the palace, and the garden. \"But the Nightingale is the best of all,\" it stood written there.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" exclaimed the Emperor. \"I don\\'t know the Nightingale at all! Is there such a bird in my empire, and even in my garden? I\\'ve never heard of that. To think that I should have to learn such a thing for the first time from books!\"\\n\\nAnd hereupon he called his cavalier. This cavalier was so grand that if anyone lower in rank than himself dared to speak to him, or to ask him any question, he answered nothing but \"P!\"—and that meant nothing.\\n\\n\"There is said to be a wonderful bird here called a Nightingale,\" said the Emperor. \"They say it is the best thing in all my great empire. Why have I never heard anything about it?\"\\n\\n\"I have never heard him named,\" replied the cavalier. \"He has never been introduced at Court.\"\\n\\n\"I command that he shall appear this evening, and sing before me,\" said the Emperor. \"All the world knows what I possess, and I do not know it myself!\"\\n\\n\"I have never heard him mentioned,\" said the cavalier. \"I will seek for him. I will find him.\"\\n\\nBut where was he to be found? The cavalier ran up and down all the staircases, through halls and passages, but no one among all those whom he met had heard talk of the Nightingale. And the cavalier ran back to the Emperor, and said that it must be a fable invented by the writers of books.\\n\\n\"Your Imperial Majesty cannot believe how much is written that is fiction, besides something that they call the black art.\"\\n\\n\"But the book in which I read this,\" said the Emperor, \"was sent to me by the high and mighty Emperor of Japan and therefore it cannot be a falsehood. I will hear the Nightingale! It must be here this evening! It has my imperial favor; and if it does not come, all the Court shall be trampled upon after the Court has supped!\"\\n\\n\"Tsing-pe!\" said the cavalier; and again he ran up and down all the staircases, and through all the halls and corridors; and half the Court ran with him, for the courtiers did not like being trampled upon.\\n\\nThen there was a great inquiry after the wonderful Nightingale, which all the world knew excepting the people at Court.\\n\\nAt last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen, who said:\\n\\n\"The Nightingale? I know it well; yes, it can sing gloriously. Every evening I get leave to carry my poor sick mother the scraps from the table. She lives down by the strand; and when I get back and am tired, and rest in the wood, then I hear the Nightingale sing. And then the water comes into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me.\"\\n\\n\"Little kitchen girl,\" said the cavalier, \"I will get you a place in the Court kitchen, with permission to see the Emperor dine, if you will but lead us to the Nightingale, for it is announced for this evening.\"\\n\\nSo they all went out into the wood where the Nightingale was accustomed to sing; half the Court went forth. When they were in the midst of their journey a cow began to low.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried the Court pages, \"now we have it! That shows a wonderful power in so small a creature! I have certainly heard it before.\"\\n\\n\"No, those are cows lowing,\" said the little kitchen girl. \"We are a long way from the place yet.\"\\n\\nNow the frogs began to croak in the marsh.\\n\\n\"Glorious!\" said the Chinese Court preacher. \"Now I hear it—it sounds just like little church bells.\"\\n\\n\"No, those are frogs,\" said the little kitchen maid. \"But now I think we shall soon hear it.\"\\n\\nAnd then the Nightingale began to sing.\\n\\n\"That is it!\" exclaimed the little girl. \"Listen, listen! and yonder it sits.\"\\n\\nAnd she pointed to a little gray bird up in the boughs.\\n\\n\"Is it possible?\" cried the cavalier. \"I should never have thought it looked like that! How simple it looks! It must certainly have lost its color at seeing such grand people around.\"\\n\\n\"Little Nightingale!\" called the little kitchen maid, quite loudly, \"our gracious Emperor wishes you to sing before him.\"\\n\\n\"With the greatest pleasure!\" replied the Nightingale, and began to sing most delightfully.\\n\\n\"It sounds just like glass bells!\" said the cavalier. \"And look at its little throat, how it\\'s working! It\\'s wonderful that we should never have heard it before. That bird will be a great success at Court.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I sing once more before the Emperor?\" inquired the Nightingale, for it thought the Emperor was present.\\n\\n\"My excellent little Nightingale,\" said the cavalier, \"I have great pleasure in inviting you to a Court festival this evening, when you shall charm his Imperial Majesty with your beautiful singing.\"\\n\\n\"My song sounds best in the green wood,\" replied the Nightingale; still it came willingly when it heard what the Emperor wished.\\n\\nThe palace was festively adorned. The walls and the flooring, which were of porcelain, gleamed in the rays of thousands of golden lamps. The most glorious flowers, which could ring clearly, had been placed in the passages. There was a running to and fro, and a thorough draught, and all the bells rang so loudly that one could not hear one\\'s self speak.\\n\\nIn the midst of the great hall, where the Emperor sat, a golden perch had been placed, on which the Nightingale was to sit. The whole Court was there, and the little cook-maid had got leave to stand behind the door, as she had now received the title of a real Court cook. All were in full dress, and all looked at the little gray bird, to which the Emperor nodded.\\n\\nAnd the Nightingale sang so gloriously that the tears came into the Emperor\\'s eyes, and the tears ran down over his cheeks; then the Nightingale sang still more sweetly, that went straight to the heart. The Emperor was so much pleased that he said the Nightingale should have his golden slipper to wear round its neck. But the Nightingale declined this with thanks, saying it had already received a sufficient reward.\\n\\n\"I have seen tears in the Emperor\\'s eyes—that is the real treasure to me. An Emperor\\'s tears have a peculiar power. I am rewarded enough!\" And then it sang again with a sweet, glorious voice.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the most amiable coquetry I ever saw!\" said the ladies who stood round about, and then they took water in their mouths to gurgle when anyone spoke to them. They thought they should be nightingales too. And the lackeys and chambermaids reported that they were satisfied also; and that was saying a good deal, for they are the most difficult to please. In short, the Nightingale achieved a real success.\\n\\nIt was now to remain at Court, to have its own cage, with liberty to go out twice every day and once at night. Twelve servants were appointed when the Nightingale went out, each of whom had a silken string fastened to the bird\\'s legs, which they held very tight. There was really no pleasure in an excursion of that kind.\\n\\nThe whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and whenever two people met, one said nothing but \"Nightin,\" and the other said \"gale\"; and then they both sighed, and understood one another. Eleven pedlars\\' children were named after the bird, but not one of them could sing a note.\\n\\nOne day the Emperor received a large parcel, on which was written, \"The Nightingale.\"\\n\\n\"There we have a new book about this celebrated bird,\" said the Emperor. 187\\n\\nBut it was not a book, but a little work of art, contained in a box—an artificial nightingale, which was to sing like a natural one, and was brilliantly ornamented with diamonds, sapphires, and rubies. So soon as the artificial bird was wound up, he could sing one of the pieces that he really sang, and then his tail moved up and down, and shone with silver and gold. Round his neck hung a little ribbon, and on that was written, \"The Emperor of China\\'s nightingale is poor compared to that of the Emperor of Japan.\"\\n\\n\"That is capital!\" said they all, and he who had brought the artificial bird immediately received the title, Imperial Head-Nightingale-Bringer.\\n\\n\"Now they must sing together; what a duet that will be!\" cried the courtiers.\\n\\nAnd so they had to sing together; but it did not sound very well, for the real Nightingale sang its own way, and the artificial bird sang waltzes.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not his fault,\" said the playmaster; \"he\\'s quite perfect, and very much in my style.\"\\n\\nNow the artificial bird was to sing alone. It had just as much success as the real one, and then it was much handsomer to look at—it shone like bracelets and breastpins.\\n\\nThree and thirty times over did it sing the same piece, and yet was not tired. The people would gladly have heard it again, but the Emperor said that the living Nightingale ought to sing something now. But where was it? No one had noticed that it had flown away out of the open window, back to the green wood.\\n\\n\"But what has become of that?\" asked the Emperor.\\n\\nAnd all the courtiers abused the Nightingale, and declared that it was a very ungrateful creature.\\n\\n\"We have the best bird after all,\" said they.\\n\\nAnd so the artificial bird had to sing again, and that was the thirty-fourth time that they listened to the same piece. For all that they did not know it quite by heart, for it was so very difficult. And the playmaster praised the bird particularly; yes, he declared that it was better than a nightingale, not only with regard to its plumage and the many beautiful diamonds, but inside as well.\\n\\n\"For you see, ladies and gentlemen, and above all, your Imperial Majesty, with a real nightingale one can never calculate what is coming, but in this artificial bird, everything is settled. One can explain it; one can open it and make people understand where the waltzes come from, how they go, and how one follows up another.\"\\n\\n\"Those are quite our own ideas,\" they all said.\\n\\nAnd the speaker received permission to show the bird to the people on the next Sunday. The people were to hear it sing too, the Emperor commanded: and they did hear it, and were as much pleased as if they had all got tipsy upon tea, for that\\'s quite the Chinese fashion, and they all said, \"Oh!\" and held up their forefingers and nodded. But the poor fisherman, who had heard the real Nightingale, said:\\n\\n\"It sounds pretty enough, and the melodies resemble each other, but there\\'s something wanting, though I know not what!\"\\n\\nThe real Nightingale was banished from the country and empire. The artificial bird had its place on a silken 188 cushion close to the Emperor\\'s bed; all the presents it had received, gold and precious stones, were ranged about it; in title it had advanced to be the High Imperial After-Dinner-Singer, and in rank to Number One on the left hand; for the Emperor considered that side the most important on which the heart is placed, and even in an Emperor the heart is on the left side; and the playmaster wrote a work of five and twenty volumes about the artificial bird; it was very learnèd and very long, full of the most difficult Chinese words; but yet all the people declared that they had read it and understood it, for fear of being considered stupid, and having their bodies trampled on.\\n\\nSo a whole year went by. The Emperor, the Court, and all the other Chinese knew every little twitter in the artificial bird\\'s song by heart. But just for that reason it pleased them best—they could sing with it themselves, and they did so. The street boys sang, \"Tsi-tsi-tsi-glug-glug!\" and the Emperor himself sang it too. Yes, that was certainly famous.\\n\\nBut one evening, when the artificial bird was singing its best, and the Emperor lay in bed listening to it, something inside the bird said, \"Whizz!\" Something cracked. \"Whir-r-r!\" All the wheels ran round, and then the music stopped.\\n\\nThe Emperor immediately sprang out of bed, and caused his body physician to be called; but what could he do? Then they sent for a watchmaker, and after a good deal of talking and investigation, the bird was put into something like order, but the watchmaker said that the bird must be carefully treated, for the barrels were worn, and it would be impossible to put new ones in in such a manner that the music would go. There was a great lamentation; only once in the year was it permitted to let the bird sing, and that was almost too much. But then the playmaster made a little speech full of heavy words, and said this was just as good as before—and so of course it was as good as before.\\n\\nNow five years had gone by, and a real grief came upon the whole nation. The Chinese were really fond of their Emperor, and now he was ill, and could not, it was said, live much longer. Already a new Emperor had been chosen, and the people stood out in the street and asked the cavalier how the Emperor did.\\n\\n\"P!\" said he, and shook his head.\\n\\nCold and pale lay the Emperor in his great, gorgeous bed; the whole Court thought him dead, and each one ran to pay homage to the new ruler. The chamberlains ran out to talk it over, and the ladies\\' maids had a great coffee party. All about, in all the halls and passages, cloth had been laid down so that no footstep could be heard, and therefore it was quiet there, quite quiet. But the Emperor was not dead yet; stiff and pale he lay on the gorgeous bed, with the long velvet curtains and the heavy gold tassels; high up, a window stood open, and the moon shone in upon the Emperor and the artificial bird.\\n\\nThe poor Emperor could scarcely breathe; it was just as if something lay upon his chest; he opened his eyes, and then he saw that it was Death who sat upon his chest, and had put on his golden crown, and held in one hand the Emperor\\'s sword, in the other his beautiful banner. And all around, from among the folds of the splendid velvet curtains, strange heads peered forth; a few very 189 ugly, the rest quite lovely and mild. These were all the Emperor\\'s bad and good deeds, that stood before him now that Death sat upon his heart.\\n\\n\"Do you remember this?\" whispered one to the other. \"Do you remember that?\" and then they told him so much that the perspiration ran from his forehead.\\n\\n\"I did not know that!\" said the Emperor. \"Music! music! the great Chinese drum!\" he cried, \"so that I need not hear all they say!\"\\n\\nAnd they continued speaking, and Death nodded like a Chinaman to all they said.\\n\\n\"Music! music!\" cried the Emperor. \"You little precious golden bird, sing, sing! I have given you gold and costly presents; I have even hung my golden slipper around your neck—sing now, sing!\"\\n\\nBut the bird stood still; no one was there to wind him up, and he could not sing without that; but Death continued to stare at the Emperor with his great, hollow eyes, and it was quiet, fearfully quiet.\\n\\nThen there sounded from the window, suddenly, the most lovely song. It was the little live Nightingale, that sat outside on a spray. It had heard of the Emperor\\'s sad plight, and had come to sing to him of comfort and hope. As it sang the specters grew paler and paler; the blood ran quicker and more quickly through the Emperor\\'s weak limbs; and even Death listened, and said:\\n\\n\"Go on, little Nightingale, go on!\"\\n\\n\"But will you give me that splendid golden sword? Will you give me that rich banner? Will you give me the Emperor\\'s crown?\"\\n\\nAnd Death gave up each of these treasures for a song. And the Nightingale sang on and on; and it sang of the quiet churchyard where the white roses grow, where the elder blossoms smell sweet, and where the fresh grass is moistened by the tears of survivors. Then Death felt a longing to see his garden, and floated out at the window in the form of a cold white mist.\\n\\n\"Thanks! thanks!\" said the Emperor. \"You heavenly little bird; I know you well. I banished you from my country and empire, and yet you have charmed away the evil faces from my couch, and banished Death from my heart! How can I reward you?\"\\n\\n\"You have rewarded me!\" replied the Nightingale. \"I have drawn tears from your eyes, when I sang the first time—I shall never forget that. Those are the jewels that rejoice a singer\\'s heart. But now sleep, and grow fresh and strong again. I will sing you something.\"\\n\\nAnd it sang, and the Emperor fell into a sweet slumber. Ah! how mild and refreshing that sleep was! The sun shone upon him through the windows when he awoke refreshed and restored: not one of his servants had yet returned, for they all thought he was dead; only the Nightingale still sat beside him and sang.\\n\\n\"You must always stay with me,\" said the Emperor. \"You shall sing as you please; and I\\'ll break the artificial bird into a thousand pieces.\"\\n\\n\"Not so,\" replied the Nightingale. \"It did well as long as it could; keep it as you have done till now. I cannot build my nest in the palace to dwell in it, but let me come when I feel the wish; then I will sit in the evening on the spray yonder by the window, and sing you something, so that you may be glad and thoughtful at once. I will sing of those who are happy and of those who suffer. 190 I will sing of good and of evil that remains hidden round about you. The little singing bird flies far around, to the poor fisherman, to the peasant\\'s roof, to everyone who dwells far away from you and from your Court. I love your heart more than your crown, and yet the crown has an air of sanctity about it. I will come and sing to you—but one thing you must promise me.\"\\n\\n\"Every thing!\" said the Emperor; and he stood there in his imperial robes, which he had put on himself, and pressed the sword which was heavy with gold to his heart.\\n\\n\"One thing I beg of you: tell no one that you have a little bird who tells you everything. Then it will go all the better.\"\\n\\nAnd the Nightingale flew away.\\n\\nThe servants came in to look at their dead Emperor, and—yes, there he stood, and the Emperor said, \"Good-morning!\"\\n\\n195\\n\\nThis story is a favorite for the Christmas season. It is loosely constructed, and rambles along for some time after it might have been expected to finish. Such rambling is often very attractive to childish listeners, as it allows the introduction of unexpected incidents. Miss Kready has some interesting suggestions about dramatizing this story in her Study of Fairy Tales, pp. 151-153. The translation is Dulcken\\'s.\\n\\nTHE FIR TREE\\n\\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\\n\\nOut in the forest stood a pretty little Fir Tree. It had a good place; it could have sunlight, air there was in plenty, and all around grew many larger comrades—pines as well as firs. But the little Fir Tree wished ardently to become greater. It did not care for the warm sun and the fresh air; it took no notice of the peasant children, who went about talking together, when they had come out to look for strawberries and raspberries. Often they came with a whole pot-full, or had strung berries on a straw; then they would sit down by the little Fir Tree and say, \"How pretty and small that one is!\" and the Fir Tree did not like to hear that at all.\\n\\nNext year he had grown a great joint, and the following year he was longer still, for in fir trees one can always tell by the number of rings they have how many years they have been growing.\\n\\n\"Oh, if I were only as great a tree as the other!\" sighed the little Fir, \"then I would spread my branches far around, and look out from my crown into the wide world. The birds would then build nests in my boughs, and when the wind blew I could nod just as grandly as the others yonder.\"\\n\\nIt took no pleasure in the sunshine, in the birds, and in the red clouds that went sailing over him morning and evening.\\n\\nWhen it was winter, and the snow lay all around, white and sparkling, a hare would often come jumping along, and spring right over the little Fir Tree. Oh! this made him so angry. But two winters went by, and when the third came the little Tree had grown so tall that the hare was obliged to run round it.\\n\\n\"Oh! to grow, to grow, and become old; that\\'s the only fine thing in the world,\" thought the Tree.\\n\\nIn the autumn woodcutters always came and felled a few of the largest trees; that was done this year too, and the little Fir Tree, that was now quite well grown, shuddered with fear, for the 191 great stately trees fell to the ground with a crash, and their branches were cut off, so that the trees looked quite naked, long, and slender—they could hardly be recognized. But then they were laid upon wagons, and horses dragged them away out of the wood. Where were they going? What destiny awaited them?\\n\\nIn the spring, when the Swallows and the Stork came, the Tree asked them, \"Do you know where they were taken? Did you not meet them?\"\\n\\nThe Swallows knew nothing about it, but the Stork looked thoughtful, nodded his head, and said:\\n\\n\"Yes, I think so. I met many new ships when I flew out of Egypt; on the ships were stately masts; I fancy these were the trees. They smelt like fir. I can assure you they\\'re stately—very stately.\"\\n\\n\"Oh that I were only big enough to go over the sea! What kind of thing is this sea, and how does it look?\"\\n\\n\"It would take too long to explain all that,\" said the Stork, and he went away.\\n\\n\"Rejoice in thy youth,\" said the Sunbeams; \"rejoice in thy fresh growth, and in the young life that is within thee.\"\\n\\nAnd the wind kissed the Tree, and the dew wept tears upon it; but the Fir Tree did not understand that.\\n\\nWhen Christmas-time approached, quite young trees were felled, sometimes trees which were neither so old nor so large as this Fir Tree, that never rested, but always wanted to go away. These young trees, which were always the most beautiful, kept all their branches; they were put upon wagons, and horses dragged them away out of the wood.\\n\\n\"Where are they all going?\" asked the Fir Tree. \"They are not greater than I—indeed, one of them was much smaller. Why do they keep all their branches? Whither are they taken?\"\\n\\n\"We know that! We know that!\" chirped the Sparrows. \"Yonder in the town we looked in at the windows. We know where they go. Oh! they are dressed up in the greatest pomp and splendor that can be imagined. We have looked in at the windows, and have perceived that they are planted in the middle of a warm room, and adorned with the most beautiful things—gilt apples, honey-cakes, playthings, and many hundred candles.\"\\n\\n\"And then?\" asked the Fir Tree, and trembled through all its branches. \"And then? What happens then?\"\\n\\n\"Why, we have not seen anything more. But it was incomparable.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I may be destined to tread this glorious path one day!\" cried the Fir Tree, rejoicingly. \"That is even better than traveling across the sea. How painfully I long for it! If it were only Christmas now! Now I am great and grown up, like the rest who were led away last year. Oh, if I were only on the carriage! If I were only in the warm room, among all the pomp and splendor! And then? Yes, then something even better will come, something far more charming, or else why should they adorn me so? There must be something grander, something greater still to come; but what? Oh! I\\'m suffering, I\\'m longing! I don\\'t know myself what is the matter with me!\"\\n\\n\"Rejoice in us,\" said Air and Sunshine. \"Rejoice in thy fresh youth here in the woodland.\"\\n\\nBut the Fir Tree did not rejoice at all, but it grew and grew; winter and summer it stood there, green, dark green. The 192 people who saw it said, \"That\\'s a handsome tree!\" and at Christmas time it was felled before any one of the others. The ax cut deep into its marrow, and the tree fell to the ground with a sigh; it felt a pain, a sensation of faintness, and could not think at all of happiness, for it was sad at parting from its home, from the place where it had grown up; it knew that it should never again see the dear old companions, the little bushes and flowers all around—perhaps not even the birds. The parting was not at all agreeable.\\n\\nThe Tree only came to itself when it was unloaded in a yard, with other trees, and heard a man say:\\n\\n\"This one is famous; we want only this one!\"\\n\\nNow two servants came in gay liveries, and carried the Fir Tree into a large, beautiful saloon. All around the walls hung pictures, and by the great stove stood large Chinese vases with lions on the covers; there were rocking-chairs, silken sofas, great tables covered with picture books, and toys worth a hundred times a hundred dollars, at least the children said so. And the Fir Tree was put into a great tub filled with sand; but no one could see that it was a tub, for it was hung round with green cloth, and stood on a large, many-colored carpet. Oh, how the Tree trembled! What was to happen now? The servants, and the young ladies also, decked it out. On one branch they hung little nets, cut out of colored paper; every net was filled with sweetmeats; golden apples and walnuts hung down, as if they grew there, and more than a hundred little candles, red, white, and blue, were fastened to the different boughs. Dolls that looked exactly like real people—the tree had never seen such before—swung among the foliage, and high on the summit of the Tree was fixed a tinsel star. It was splendid, particularly splendid.\\n\\n\"This evening,\" said all, \"this evening it will shine.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" thought the Tree, \"that it were evening already! Oh, that the lights may be soon lit up! When may that be done? I wonder if trees will come out of the forest to look at me? Will the sparrows fly against the panes? Shall I grow fast here, and stand adorned in summer and winter?\"\\n\\nYes, he did not guess badly. But he had a complete backache from mere longing, and the backache is just as bad for a Tree as the headache for a person.\\n\\nAt last the candles were lighted. What a brilliance, what splendor! The Tree trembled so in all its branches that one of the candles set fire to a green twig, and it was scorched.\\n\\n\"Heaven preserve us!\" cried the young ladies; and they hastily put the fire out.\\n\\nNow the Tree might not even tremble. Oh, that was terrible! It was so afraid of setting fire to some of its ornaments, and it was quite bewildered with all the brilliance. And now the folding doors were thrown open, and a number of children rushed in as if they would have overturned the whole Tree; the older people followed more deliberately. The little ones stood quite silent, but only for a minute; then they shouted till the room rang: they danced gleefully round the Tree, and one present after another was plucked from it.\\n\\n\"What are they about?\" thought the Tree. \"What\\'s going to be done?\"\\n\\nAnd the candles burned down to the twigs, and as they burned down they 193 were extinguished, and then the children received permission to plunder the Tree. Oh! they rushed in upon it, so that every branch cracked again: if it had not been fastened by the top and by the golden star to the ceiling, it would have fallen down.\\n\\nThe children danced about with their pretty toys. No one looked at the Tree except one old man, who came up and peeped among the branches, but only to see if a fig or an apple had not been forgotten.\\n\\n\"A story! A story!\" shouted the children; and they drew a little fat man toward the tree; and he sat down just beneath it—\"for then we shall be in the green wood,\" said he, \"and the tree may have the advantage of listening to my tale. But I can only tell one. Will you hear the story of Ivede-Avede, or of Klumpey-Dumpey, who fell downstairs, and still was raised up to honor and married the Princess?\"\\n\\n\"Ivede-Avede!\" cried some, \"Klumpey-Dumpey!\" cried others, and there was a great crying and shouting. Only the Fir Tree was quite silent, and thought, \"Shall I not be in it? Shall I have nothing to do in it?\" But he had been in the evening\\'s amusement, and had done what was required of him.\\n\\nAnd the fat man told about Klumpey-Dumpey who fell downstairs, and yet was raised to honor and married the Princess. And the children clapped their hands, and cried, \"Tell another! tell another!\" for they wanted to hear about Ivede-Avede; but they only got the story of Klumpey-Dumpey. The Fir Tree stood quite silent and thoughtful; never had the birds in the wood told such a story as that. Klumpey-Dumpey fell downstairs, and yet came to honor and married the Princess!\\n\\n\"Yes, so it happens in the world!\" thought the Fir Tree, and believed it must be true, because that was such a nice man who told it. \"Well, who can know? Perhaps I shall fall downstairs, too, and marry a Princess!\" And it looked forward with pleasure to being adorned again, the next evening, with candles and toys, gold and fruit. \"To-morrow I shall not tremble,\" it thought.\\n\\n\"I will rejoice in all my splendor. To-morrow I shall hear the story of Klumpey-Dumpey again, and perhaps that of Ivede-Avede, too.\"\\n\\nAnd the Tree stood all night quiet and thoughtful.\\n\\nIn the morning the servants and the chambermaid came in.\\n\\n\"Now my splendor will begin afresh,\" thought the Tree. But they dragged him out of the room, and upstairs to the garret, and here they put him in a dark corner where no daylight shone.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the meaning of this?\" thought the Tree. \"What am I to do here? What is to happen?\"\\n\\nAnd he leaned against the wall, and thought, and thought. And he had time enough, for days and nights went by, and nobody came up; and when at length someone came, it was only to put some great boxes in a corner. Now the Tree stood quite hidden away, and the supposition is that it was quite forgotten.\\n\\n\"Now it\\'s winter outside,\" thought the Tree. \"The earth is hard and covered with snow, and people cannot plant me; therefore I suppose I\\'m to be sheltered here until spring comes. How considerate that is! How good people are! If it were only not so dark 194 here, and so terribly solitary!—not even a little hare? That was pretty out there in the wood, when the snow lay thick and the hare sprang past; yes, even when he jumped over me; but then I did not like it. It is terribly lonely up here!\"\\n\\n\"Piep! piep!\" said a little Mouse, and crept forward, and then came another little one. They smelt at the Fir Tree, and then slipped among the branches.\\n\\n\"It\\'s horribly cold,\" said the two little Mice, \"or else it would be comfortable here. Don\\'t you think so, you old Fir Tree?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not old at all,\" said the Fir Tree. \"There are many much older than I.\"\\n\\n\"Where do you come from?\" asked the Mice. \"And what do you know?\" They were dreadfully inquisitive. \"Tell us about the most beautiful spot on earth. Have you been there? Have you been in the store room, where cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from the ceiling, where one dances on tallow candles, and goes in thin and comes out fat?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that,\" replied the Tree; \"but I know the wood, where the sun shines and the birds sing.\"\\n\\nAnd then it told all about its youth.\\n\\nAnd the little Mice had never heard anything of the kind; and they listened and said:\\n\\n\"What a number of things you have seen! How happy you must have been!\"\\n\\n\"I?\" replied the Fir Tree; and it thought about what it had told. \"Yes, those were really quite happy times.\" But then he told of the Christmas Eve, when he had been hung with sweetmeats and candles.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said the little Mice, \"how happy you have been, you old Fir Tree!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not old at all,\" said the Tree. \"I only came out of the wood this winter. I\\'m only rather backward in my growth.\"\\n\\n\"What splendid stories you can tell!\" said the little Mice.\\n\\nAnd next night they came with four other little Mice, to hear what the Tree had to relate; and the more it said, the more clearly did it remember everything, and thought, \"Those were quite merry days! But they may come again. Klumpey-Dumpey fell downstairs, and yet he married the Princess. Perhaps I may marry a Princess too!\" And the Fir Tree thought of a pretty little Birch Tree that grew out in the forest; for the Fir Tree, that Birch was a real Princess.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s Klumpey-Dumpey?\" asked the little Mice.\\n\\nAnd then the Fir Tree told the whole story. It could remember every single word; and the little Mice were ready to leap to the very top of the tree with pleasure. Next night a great many more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats even appeared; but these thought the story was not pretty, and the little Mice were sorry for that, for now they also did not like it so much as before.\\n\\n\"Do you only know one story?\" asked the Rats.\\n\\n\"Only that one,\" replied the Tree. \"I heard that on the happiest evening of my life; I did not think then how happy I was.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a very miserable story. Don\\'t you know any about bacon and tallow candles—a store-room story?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Tree.\\n\\n\"Then we\\'d rather not hear you,\" said the Rats.\\n\\nAnd they went back to their own people. The little Mice at last stayed 195 away also; and then the Tree sighed and said:\\n\\n\"It was very nice when they sat round me, the merry little Mice, and listened when I spoke to them. Now that\\'s past too. But I shall remember to be pleased when they take me out.\"\\n\\nBut when did that happen? Why, it was one morning that people came and rummaged in the garret: the boxes were put away, and the Tree brought out; they certainly threw him rather roughly on the floor, but a servant dragged him away at once to the stairs, where the daylight shone.\\n\\n\"Now life is beginning again!\" thought the Tree.\\n\\nIt felt the fresh air and the first sunbeams, and now it was out in the courtyard. Everything passed so quickly that the Tree quite forgot to look at itself, there was so much to look at all round. The courtyard was close to a garden, and here everything was blooming; the roses hung fresh and fragrant over the little paling, the linden trees were in blossom, and the swallows cried, \"Quinze-wit! quinze-wit! my husband\\'s come!\" But it was not the Fir Tree that they meant.\\n\\n\"Now I shall live!\" said the Tree, rejoicingly, and spread its branches far out; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow; and it lay in the corner among nettles and weeds. The tinsel star was still upon it, and shone in the bright sunshine.\\n\\nIn the courtyard a couple of the merry children were playing who had danced round the tree at Christmas time, and had rejoiced over it. One of the youngest ran up and tore off the golden star.\\n\\n\"Look what is sticking to the ugly old fir tree!\" said the child, and he trod upon the branches till they cracked again under his boots.\\n\\nAnd the Tree looked at all the blooming flowers and the splendor of the garden, and then looked at itself, and wished it had remained in the dark corner of the garret; it thought of its fresh youth in the wood, of the merry Christmas Eve, and of the little Mice which had listened so pleasantly to the story of Klumpey-Dumpey.\\n\\n\"Past! past!\" said the old Tree. \"Had I but rejoiced when I could have done so! Past! past!\"\\n\\nAnd the servant came and chopped the Tree into little pieces; a whole bundle lay there; it blazed brightly under the great brewing copper, and it sighed deeply, and each sigh was like a little shot; and the children who were at play there ran up and seated themselves at the fire, looked into it, and cried \"Puff! puff!\" But at each explosion, which was a deep sigh, the Tree thought of a summer day in the woods, or of a winter night there, when the stars beamed; he thought of Christmas Eve and of Klumpey-Dumpey, the only story he had ever heard or knew how to tell; and then the Tree was burned.\\n\\nThe boys played in the garden, and the youngest had on his breast a golden star, which the Tree had worn on its happiest evening. Now that was past, and the Tree\\'s life was past, and the story is past too: past! past!—and that\\'s the way with all stories.\\n\\n196\\n\\nThe tale that follows was one of the author\\'s earliest stories, published in 1835. It is clearly based upon an old folk tale, one variant of which is \"The Blue Light\" from the Grimm collection (No. 174). \"It was 196 a lucky stroke,\" says Brandes, \"that made Andersen the poet of children. After long fumbling, after unsuccessful efforts, which must necessarily throw a false and ironic light on the self-consciousness of a poet whose pride based its justification mainly on the expectancy of a future which he felt slumbering within his soul, after wandering about for long years, Andersen … one evening found himself in front of a little insignificant yet mysterious door, the door of the nursery story. He touched it, it yielded, and he saw, burning in the obscurity within, the little \\'Tinder-Box\\' that became his Aladdin\\'s lamp. He struck fire with it, and the spirits of the lamp—the dogs with eyes as large as tea-cups, as mill-wheels, as the round tower in Copenhagen—stood before him and brought him the three giant chests, containing all the copper, silver, and gold treasure stories of the nursery story. The first story had sprung into existence, and the \\'Tinder-Box\\' drew all the others onward in its train. Happy is he who has found his \\'tinder-box.\\'\" The translation is by H. W. Dulcken.\\n\\nTHE TINDER-BOX\\n\\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\\n\\nThere came a soldier marching along the high road—one, two! one, two! He had his knapsack on his back and a saber by his side, for he had been in the wars, and now he wanted to go home. And on the way he met with an old witch; she was very hideous, and her under lip hung down upon her breast. She said, \"Good evening, soldier. What a fine sword you have, and what a big knapsack! You\\'re a proper soldier! Now you shall have as much money as you like to have.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you, you old witch!\" said the soldier.\\n\\n\"Do you see that great tree?\" quoth the witch; and she pointed to a tree which stood beside them. \"It\\'s quite hollow inside. You must climb to the top, and then you\\'ll see a hole, through which you can let yourself down and get deep into the tree. I\\'ll tie a rope round your body, so that I can pull you up again when you call me.\"\\n\\n\"What am I to do down in the tree?\" asked the soldier.\\n\\n\"Get money,\" replied the witch. \"Listen to me. When you come down to the earth under the tree, you will find yourself in a great hall: it is quite light, for above three hundred lamps are burning there. Then you will see three doors; those you can open, for the keys are hanging there. If you go into the first chamber, you\\'ll see a great chest in the middle of the floor; on this chest sits a dog, and he\\'s got a pair of eyes as big as two tea-cups. But you need not care for that. I\\'ll give you my blue-checked apron, and you can spread it out upon the floor; then go up quickly and take the dog, and set him on my apron; then open the chest, and take as many shillings as you like. They are of copper: if you prefer silver, you must go into the second chamber. But there sits a dog with a pair of eyes as big as mill-wheels. But do not you care for that. Set him upon my apron, and take some of the money. And if you want gold, you can have that too—in fact, as much as you can carry—if you go into the third chamber. But the dog that sits on the money-chest there has two eyes as big as round towers. He is a fierce dog, you may be sure; but you needn\\'t be afraid, for all that. Only set him on my apron, and he won\\'t hurt you; and take out of the chest as much gold as you like.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not so bad,\" said the soldier. \"But what am I to give you, old witch? for you will not do it for nothing, I fancy.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied the witch, \"not a single shilling will I have. You shall only bring me an old tinder-box which my grandmother forgot when she was down there last.\"\\n\\n\"Then tie the rope round my body,\" cried the soldier.\\n\\n\"Here it is,\" said the witch, \"and here\\'s my blue-checked apron.\"\\n\\nThen the soldier climbed up into the tree, let himself slip down into the hole, and stood, as the witch had said, in the great hall where the three hundred lamps were burning.\\n\\nNow he opened the first door. Ugh! there sat the dog with eyes as big as tea-cups, staring at him. \"You\\'re a nice fellow!\" exclaimed the soldier; and he set him on the witch\\'s apron, and took as many copper shillings as his pockets would hold, and then locked the chest, set the dog on it again, and went into the second chamber. Aha! there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.\\n\\n\"You should not stare so hard at me,\" said the soldier; \"you might strain your eyes.\" And he set the dog upon the witch\\'s apron. And when he saw the silver money in the chest, he threw away all the copper money he had, and filled his pocket and his knapsack with silver only. Then he went into the third chamber. Oh, but that was horrid! The dog there really had eyes as big as towers, and they turned round and round in his head like wheels.\\n\\n\"Good evening!\" said the soldier; and he touched his cap, for he had never seen such a dog as that before. When he had looked at him a little more closely, he thought, \"That will do,\" and lifted him down to the floor, and opened the chest. Mercy! what a quantity of gold was there! He could buy with it the whole town, and the sugar sucking-pigs of the cake woman, and all the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horses in the whole world. Yes, that was a quantity of money! Now the soldier threw away all the silver coin with which he had filled his pockets and his knapsack, and took gold instead: yes, all his pockets, his knapsack, his boots, and his cap were filled, so that he could scarcely walk. Now indeed he had plenty of money. He put the dog on the chest, shut the door, and then called up through the tree, \"Now pull me up, you old witch.\"\\n\\n\"Have you the tinder-box?\" asked the witch.\\n\\n\"Plague on it!\" exclaimed the soldier, \"I had clean forgotten that.\" And he went and brought it.\\n\\nThe witch drew him up, and he stood on the high road again, with pockets, boots, knapsack, and cap full of gold.\\n\\n\"What are you going to do with the tinder-box?\" asked the soldier.\\n\\n\"That\\'s nothing to you,\" retorted the witch. \"You\\'ve had your money—just give me the tinder-box.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" said the soldier. \"Tell me directly what you\\'re going to do with it, or I\\'ll draw my sword and cut off your head.\"\\n\\n\"No!\" cried the witch.\\n\\nSo the soldier cut off her head. There she lay! But he tied up all his money in her apron, took it on his back like a bundle, put the tinder-box in his pocket, and went straight off toward the town.\\n\\nThat was a splendid town! And he put up at the very best inn and asked for the finest rooms, and ordered his 198 favorite dishes, for now he was rich, as he had so much money. The servant who had to clean his boots certainly thought them a remarkably old pair for such a rich gentleman; but he had not bought any new ones yet. The next day he procured proper boots and handsome clothes. Now our soldier had become a fine gentleman; and the people told him of all the splendid things which were in their city, and about the King, and what a pretty Princess the King\\'s daughter was.\\n\\n\"Where can one get to see her?\" asked the soldier.\\n\\n\"She is not to be seen at all,\" said they, all together; \"she lives in a great copper castle, with a great many walls and towers round about it; no one but the King may go in and out there, for it has been prophesied that she shall marry a common soldier, and the King can\\'t bear that.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to see her,\" thought the soldier; but he could not get leave to do so. Now he lived merrily, went to the theater, drove in the King\\'s garden, and gave much money to the poor; and this was very kind of him, for he knew from old times how hard it is when one has not a shilling. Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and gained many friends, who all said he was a rare one, a true cavalier; and that pleased the soldier well. But as he spent money every day and never earned any, he had at last only two shillings left; and he was obliged to turn out of the fine rooms in which he had dwelt, and had to live in a little garret under the roof, and clean his boots for himself, and mend them with a darning-needle. None of his friends came to see him, for there were too many stairs to climb.\\n\\nIt was quite dark one evening, and he could not even buy himself a candle, when it occurred to him that there was a candle-end in the tinder-box which he had taken out of the hollow tree into which the witch had helped him. He brought out the tinder-box and the candle-end; but as soon as he struck fire and the sparks rose up from the flint, the door flew open, and the dog who had eyes as big as a couple of tea-cups, and whom he had seen in the tree, stood before him, and said:\\n\\n\"What are my lord\\'s commands?\"\\n\\n\"What is this?\" said the soldier. \"That\\'s a famous tinder-box, if I can get everything with it that I want! Bring me some money,\" said he to the dog: and whisk! the dog was gone, and whisk! he was back again, with a great bag full of shillings in his mouth.\\n\\nNow the soldier knew what a capital tinder-box this was. If he struck it once, the dog came who sat upon the chest of copper money; if he struck it twice, the dog came who had the silver; and if he struck it three times, then appeared the dog who had the gold. Now the soldier moved back into the fine rooms, and appeared again in handsome clothes; and all his friends knew him again, and cared very much for him indeed.\\n\\nOnce he thought to himself, \"It is a very strange thing that one cannot get to see the Princess. They all say she is very beautiful; but what is the use of that, if she has always to sit in the great copper castle with the many towers? Can I not get to see her at all? Where is my tinder-box?\" And so he struck a light, and whisk! came the dog with eyes as big as tea-cups.\\n\\n\"It is midnight, certainly,\" said the soldier, \"but I should very much like 199 to see the Princess, only for one little moment.\"\\n\\nAnd the dog was outside the door directly, and, before the soldier thought it, came back with the Princess. She sat upon the dog\\'s back and slept; and everyone could see she was a real Princess, for she was so lovely. The soldier could not refrain from kissing her, for he was a thorough soldier. Then the dog ran back again with the Princess. But when morning came, and the King and Queen were drinking tea, the Princess said she had had a strange dream, the night before, about a dog and a soldier—that she had ridden upon the dog, and the soldier had kissed her.\\n\\n\"That would be a fine history!\" said the Queen.\\n\\nSo one of the old Court ladies had to watch the next night by the Princess\\'s bed, to see if this was really a dream, or what it might be.\\n\\nThe soldier had a great longing to see the lovely Princess again; so the dog came in the night, took her away, and ran as fast as he could. But the old lady put on water-boots, and ran just as fast after him. When she saw that they both entered a great house, she thought, \"Now I know where it is\"; and with a bit of chalk she drew a great cross on the door. Then she went home and lay down, and the dog came up with the Princess; but when he saw that there was a cross drawn on the door where the soldier lived, he took a piece of chalk too, and drew crosses on all the doors in the town. And that was cleverly done, for now the lady could not find the right door, because all the doors had crosses upon them.\\n\\nIn the morning early came the King and the Queen, the old Court lady and all the officers, to see where it was the Princess had been. \"Here it is!\" said the King, when he saw the first door with a cross upon it. \"No, my dear husband, it is there!\" said the Queen, who descried another door which also showed a cross. \"But there is one, and there is one!\" said all, for wherever they looked there were crosses on the doors. So they saw that it would avail them nothing if they searched on.\\n\\nBut the Queen was an exceedingly clever woman, who could do more than ride in a coach. She took her great gold scissors, cut a piece of silk into pieces, and made a neat little bag: this bag she filled with fine wheat flour, and tied it on the Princess\\'s back; and when that was done, she cut a little hole in the bag, so that the flour would be scattered along all the way which the Princess should take.\\n\\nIn the night the dog came again, took the Princess on his back, and ran with her to the soldier, who loved her very much, and would gladly have been a prince, so that he might have her for his wife. The dog did not notice at all how the flour ran out in a stream from the castle to the windows of the soldier\\'s house, where he ran up the wall with the Princess. In the morning the King and Queen saw well enough where their daughter had been, and they took the soldier and put him in prison.\\n\\nThere he sat. Oh, but it was dark and disagreeable there! And they said to him, \"To-morrow you shall be hanged.\" That was not amusing to hear, and he had left his tinder-box at the inn. In the morning he could see, through the iron grating of the little window, how the people were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged. He heard the 200 drums beat and saw the soldiers marching. All the people were running out, and among them was a shoemaker\\'s boy with leather apron and slippers, and he galloped so fast that one of his slippers flew off, and came right against the wall where the soldier sat looking through the iron grating.\\n\\n\"Halloo, you shoemaker\\'s boy! you needn\\'t be in such a hurry,\" cried the soldier to him: \"it will not begin till I come. But if you will run to where I lived, and bring me my tinder-box, you shall have four shillings; but you must put your best leg foremost.\"\\n\\nThe shoemaker\\'s boy wanted to get the four shillings, so he went and brought the tinder-box, and—well, we shall hear now what happened.\\n\\nOutside the town a great gallows had been built, and around it stood the soldiers and many hundred thousand people. The King and Queen sat on a splendid throne, opposite to the Judges and the whole Council. The soldier already stood upon the ladder; but as they were about to put the rope round his neck, he said that before a poor criminal suffered his punishment an innocent request was always granted to him. He wanted very much to smoke a pipe of tobacco, as it would be the last pipe he should smoke in this world. The King would not say \"No\" to this; so the soldier took his tinder-box and struck fire. One—two—three—! and there suddenly stood all the dogs—the one with eyes as big as tea-cups, the one with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and the one whose eyes were as big as round towers.\\n\\n\"Help me now, so that I may not be hanged,\" said the soldier. And the dogs fell upon the Judge and all the Council, seized one by the leg and another by the nose, and tossed them all many feet into the air, so that they fell down and were all broken to pieces.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t!\" cried the King; but the biggest dog took him and the Queen and threw them after the others. Then the soldiers were afraid, and the people cried, \"Little soldier, you shall be our King, and marry the beautiful Princess!\"\\n\\nSo they put the soldier into the King\\'s coach, and all the three dogs darted on in front and cried \"Hurrah!\" and the boys whistled through their fingers, and the soldiers presented arms. The Princess came out of the copper castle, and became Queen, and she liked that well enough. The wedding lasted a week, and the three dogs sat at the table too, and opened their eyes wider than ever at all they saw.\\n\\n197\\n\\nThe following is one of Andersen\\'s early stories, published in 1838. It has always been a great favorite. Whimsically odd couples, in this case so constant in their devotion to each other, seemed to appeal to Andersen. The romance of the Whip Top and the Ball in the little story \"The Lovers\" deals with another odd couple. \"Constant\" or \"steadfast\" are terms sometimes used in the different versions instead of \"hardy,\" and, if they seem better to carry the meaning intended, teachers should feel free to substitute one of them in telling or reading the story. The translation is by H. W. Dulcken.\\n\\nTHE HARDY TIN SOLDIER\\n\\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\\n\\nThere were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers; they were all brothers, for they had all been born of one old tin spoon. 201 They shouldered their muskets, and looked straight before them; their uniform was red and blue, and very splendid. The first thing they had heard in the world, when the lid was taken off their box, had been the words, \"Tin soldiers!\" These words were uttered by a little boy, clapping his hands: the soldiers had been given to him, for it was his birthday; and now he put them upon the table. Each soldier was exactly like the rest; but one of them had been cast last of all, and there had not been enough tin to finish him; but he stood as firmly upon his one leg as the others on their two; and it was just this Soldier who became remarkable.\\n\\nOn the table on which they had been placed stood many other playthings, but the toy that attracted most attention was a neat castle of cardboard. Through the little windows one could see straight into the hall. Before the castle some little trees were placed round a little looking-glass, which was to represent a clear lake. Waxen swans swam on this lake, and were mirrored in it. This was all very pretty; but the prettiest of all was a little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; she was also cut out in paper, but she had a dress of the clearest gauze, and a little narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders, that looked like a scarf; and in the middle of this ribbon was a shining tinsel rose as big as her whole face. The little lady stretched out both her arms, for she was a dancer; and then she lifted one leg so high that the Tin Soldier could not see it at all, and thought that, like himself, she had but one leg.\\n\\n\"That would be the wife for me,\" thought he; \"but she is very grand. She lives in a castle, and I have only a box, and there are five-and-twenty of us in that. It is no place for her. But I must try to make acquaintance with her.\"\\n\\nAnd then he lay down at full length behind a snuff-box which was on the table; there he could easily watch the little dainty lady, who continued to stand upon one leg without losing her balance.\\n\\nWhen the evening came all the other tin soldiers were put into their box, and the people in the house went to bed. Now the toys began to play at \"visiting,\" and at \"war,\" and \"giving balls.\" The tin soldiers rattled in their box, for they wanted to join, but could not lift the lid. The nutcracker threw somersaults, and the pencil amused itself on the table; there was so much noise that the canary woke up, and began to speak too, and even in verse. The only two who did not stir from their places were the Tin Soldier and the Dancing Lady: she stood straight up on the point of one of her toes, and stretched out both her arms; and he was just as enduring on his one leg; and he never turned his eyes away from her.\\n\\nNow the clock struck twelve—and, bounce! the lid flew off the snuff-box; but there was no snuff in it, but a little black Goblin: you see, it was a trick.\\n\\n\"Tin Soldier!\" said the Goblin, \"don\\'t stare at things that don\\'t concern you.\"\\n\\nBut the Tin Soldier pretended not to hear him.\\n\\n\"Just you wait till to-morrow!\" said the Goblin.\\n\\nBut when the morning came, and the children got up, the Tin Soldier was placed in the window; and whether it was the Goblin or the draught that did it, all at once the window flew open, 202 and the Soldier fell head over heels out of the third story. That was a terrible passage! He put his leg straight up, and stuck with helmet downward and his bayonet between the paving-stones.\\n\\nThe servant-maid and the little boy came down directly to look for him, but though they almost trod upon him, they could not see him. If the Soldier had cried out \"Here I am!\" they would have found him; but he did not think it fitting to call out loudly, because he was in uniform.\\n\\nNow it began to rain; the drops soon fell thicker, and at last it came down into a complete stream. When the rain was past, two street boys came by.\\n\\n\"Just look!\" said one of them, \"there lies a Tin Soldier. He must come out and ride in the boat.\"\\n\\nAnd they made a boat out of a newspaper, and put the Tin Soldier in the middle of it, and so he sailed down the gutter, and the two boys ran beside him and clapped their hands. Goodness preserve us! how the waves rose in that gutter, and how fast the stream ran! But then it had been a heavy rain. The paper boat rocked up and down, and sometimes turned round so rapidly that the Tin Soldier trembled; but he remained firm, and never changed countenance, and looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket.\\n\\nAll at once the boat went into a long drain, and it became as dark as if he had been in his box.\\n\\n\"Where am I going now?\" he thought. \"Yes, yes, that\\'s the Goblin\\'s fault. Ah! if the little lady only sat here with me in the boat, it might be twice as dark for what I should care.\"\\n\\nSuddenly there came a great Water Rat, which lived under the drain.\\n\\n\"Have you a passport?\" said the Rat. \"Give me your passport.\"\\n\\nBut the Tin Soldier kept silence, and held his musket tighter than ever.\\n\\nThe boat went on, but the Rat came after it. Hu! how he gnashed his teeth, and called out to the bits of straw and wood:\\n\\n\"Hold him! hold him! He hasn\\'t paid toll—he hasn\\'t shown his passport!\"\\n\\nBut the stream became stronger and stronger. The Tin Soldier could see the bright daylight where the arch ended; but he heard a roaring noise which might well frighten a bolder man. Only think—just where the tunnel ended, the drain ran into a great canal; and for him that would have been as dangerous as for us to be carried down a great waterfall.\\n\\nNow he was already so near it that he could not stop. The boat was carried out, the poor Tin Soldier stiffening himself as much as he could, and no one could say that he moved an eyelid. The boat whirled round three or four times, and was full of water to the very edge—it must sink. The Tin Soldier stood up to his neck in water, and the boat sank deeper and deeper, and the paper was loosened more and more; and now the water closed over the soldier\\'s head. Then he thought of the pretty little Dancer, and how he should never see her again; and it sounded in the soldier\\'s ears:\\n\\nFarewell, farewell, thou warrior brave, For this day thou must die!\\n\\nTranscriber\\'s Note: original reads \\'warrier\\'\\n\\nAnd now the paper parted, and the Tin Soldier fell out; but at that moment he was snapped up by a great fish.\\n\\nOh, how dark it was in that fish\\'s body! It was darker yet than in the 203 drain tunnel; and then it was very narrow too. But the Tin Soldier remained unmoved, and lay at full length shouldering his musket.\\n\\nThe fish swam to and fro; he made the most wonderful movements, and then became quite still. At last something flashed through him like lightning. The daylight shone quite clear, and a voice said aloud, \"The Tin Soldier!\" The fish had been caught, carried to market, bought, and taken into the kitchen, where the cook cut him open with a large knife. She seized the Soldier round the body with both her hands and carried him into the room, where all were anxious to see the remarkable man who had traveled about in the inside of a fish; but the Tin Soldier was not at all proud. They placed him on the table, and there—no! What curious things may happen in the world. The Tin Soldier was in the very room in which he had been before! He saw the same children, and the same toys stood on the table; and there was the pretty castle with the graceful little Dancer. She was still balancing herself on one leg, and held the other extended in the air. She was hardy too. That moved the Tin Soldier; he was very nearly weeping tin tears, but that would not have been proper. He looked at her, but they said nothing to each other.\\n\\nThen one of the little boys took the Tin Soldier and flung him into the stove. He gave no reason for doing this. It must have been the fault of the Goblin in the snuff-box.\\n\\nThe Tin Soldier stood there quite illuminated, and felt a heat that was terrible; but whether this heat proceeded from the real fire or from love he did not know. The colors had quite gone off from him; but whether that had happened on the journey, or had been caused by grief, no one could say. He looked at the little lady, she looked at him, and he felt that he was melting; but he still stood firm, shouldering his musket. Then suddenly the door flew open, and the draught of air caught the Dancer, and she flew like a sylph just into the stove to the Tin Soldier, and flashed up in a flame, and she was gone. Then the Tin Soldier melted down into a lump; and when the servant-maid took the ashes out next day, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. But of the Dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, and that was burned as black as a coal.\\n\\n198\\n\\n\"The Ugly Duckling\" has always been regarded as one of Andersen\\'s most exquisite stories. No one can fail to notice the parallel that suggests itself between the successive stages in the duckling\\'s history and those in Andersen\\'s own life. In this story, remarks Dr. Brandes, \"there is the quintessence of the author\\'s entire life (melancholy, humor, martyrdom, triumph) and of his whole nature: the gift of observation and the sparkling intellect which he used to avenge himself upon folly and wickedness, the varied faculties which constitute his genius.\" The standards of judgment used by the ducks, the turkey, the hen, and the cat are all delightfully and humorously satirical of human stupidity and shortsightedness. The translation used is by H. W. Dulcken.\\n\\nTHE UGLY DUCKLING\\n\\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\\n\\nIt was glorious out in the country. It was summer, and the cornfields were yellow, and the oats were green; the hay 204 had been put up in stacks in the green meadows, and the stork went about on his long red legs, and chattered Egyptian, for this was the language he had learned from his good mother. All around the fields and meadows were great forests, and in the midst of these forests lay deep lakes. Yes, it was really glorious out in the country. In the midst of the sunshine there lay an old farm, surrounded by deep canals, and from the wall down to the water grew great burdocks, so high that little children could stand upright under the loftiest of them. It was just as wild there as in the deepest wood. Here sat a Duck upon her nest, for she had to hatch her young ones; but she was almost tired out before the little ones came; and then she so seldom had visitors. The other ducks liked better to swim about in the canals than to run up to sit down under a burdock and cackle with her.\\n\\nAt last one eggshell after another burst open. \"Piep! piep!\" it cried, and in all the eggs there were little creatures that stuck out their heads.\\n\\n\"Rap! rap!\" they said; and they all came rapping out as fast as they could, looking all round them under the green leaves; and the mother let them look as much as they chose, for green is good for the eyes.\\n\\n\"How wide the world is!\" said the young ones, for they certainly had much more room now than when they were in the eggs.\\n\\n\"Do you think this is all the world!\" asked the mother. \"That extends far across the other side of the garden, quite into the parson\\'s field, but I have never been there yet. I hope you are all together,\" she continued, and stood up. \"No, I have not all. The largest egg still lies there. How long is that to last? I am really tired of it.\" And she sat down again.\\n\\n\"Well, how goes it?\" asked an old Duck who had come to pay her a visit.\\n\\n\"It lasts a long time with that one egg,\" said the Duck who sat there. \"It will not burst. Now, only look at the others; are they not the prettiest ducks one could possibly see? They are all like their father; the bad fellow never comes to see me.\"\\n\\n\"Let me see the egg which will not burst,\" said the old visitor. \"Believe me, it is a turkey\\'s egg. I was once cheated in that way, and had much anxiety and trouble with the young ones, for they are afraid of the water. I could not get them to venture in. I quacked and clucked, but it was of no use. Let me see the egg. Yes, that\\'s a turkey\\'s egg! Let it lie there, and you teach the other children to swim.\"\\n\\n\"I think I will sit on it a little longer,\" said the Duck. \"I\\'ve sat so long now that I can sit a few days more.\"\\n\\n\"Just as you please,\" said the old Duck; and she went away.\\n\\nAt last the great egg burst. \"Piep! piep!\" said the little one, and crept forth. It was very large and very ugly. The Duck looked at it.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a very large duckling,\" said she; \"none of the others look like that; can it really be a turkey chick? Now we shall soon find out. It must go into the water, even if I have to thrust it in myself.\"\\n\\nThe next day the weather was splendidly bright, and the sun shone on all the green trees. The Mother-Duck went down to the water with all her little ones. Splash! she jumped into the water. \"Quack! quack!\" she said, and then one duckling after another plunged in. The 205 water closed over their heads, but they came up in an instant, and swam capitally; their legs went of themselves, and there they were, all in the water. The ugly gray Duckling swam with them.\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s not a turkey,\" said she; \"look how well it can use its legs, and how upright it holds itself. It is my own child! On the whole it\\'s quite pretty, if one looks at it rightly. Quack! quack! come with me, and I\\'ll lead you out into the great world, and present you in the poultry-yard; but keep close to me, so that no one may tread on you; and take care of the cats!\"\\n\\nAnd so they came into the poultry-yard. There was a terrible riot going on in there, for two families were quarreling about an eel\\'s head, and the cat got it after all.\\n\\n\"See, that\\'s how it goes in the world!\" said the Mother-Duck; and she whetted her beak, for she, too, wanted the eel\\'s head. \"Only use your legs,\" she said. \"See that you bustle about, and bow your heads before the old Duck yonder. She\\'s the grandest of all here; she\\'s of Spanish blood—that\\'s why she\\'s so fat; and do you see, she has a red rag round her leg; that\\'s something particularly fine, and the greatest distinction a duck can enjoy; it signifies that one does not want to lose her, and that she\\'s to be recognized by man and beast. Shake yourselves—don\\'t turn in your toes; a well-brought-up Duck turns its toes quite out, just like father and mother, so! Now bend your necks and say \\'Rap!\\'\"\\n\\nAnd they did so; but the other Ducks round about looked at them, and said quite boldly:\\n\\n\"Look there! now we\\'re to have these hanging on, as if there were not enough of us already! And—fie—! how that Duckling yonder looks; we won\\'t stand that!\" And one duck flew up immediately, and bit it in the neck.\\n\\n\"Let it alone,\" said the mother; \"it does no harm to anyone.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but it\\'s too large and peculiar,\" said the Duck who had bitten it; \"and therefore it must be buffeted.\"\\n\\n\"Those are pretty children that the mother has there,\" said the old Duck with the rag round her leg. \"They\\'re all pretty but that one; that was a failure. I wish she could alter it.\"\\n\\n\"That cannot be done, my lady,\" replied the Mother-Duck. \"It is not pretty, but it has a really good disposition, and swims as well as any other; I may even say it swims better. I think it will grow up pretty, and become smaller in time; it has lain too long in the egg, and therefore is not properly shaped.\" And then she pinched it in the neck, and smoothed its feathers. \"Moreover, it is a drake,\" she said, \"and therefore it is not of so much consequence. I think he will be very strong; he makes his way already.\"\\n\\n\"The other ducklings are graceful enough,\" said the old Duck. \"Make yourself at home; and if you find an eel\\'s head, you may bring it me.\"\\n\\nAnd now they were at home. But the poor Duckling which had crept last out of the egg, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and jeered, as much by the ducks as by the chickens.\\n\\n\"It is too big!\" they all said. And the turkey-cock, who had been born with spurs, and therefore thought himself an Emperor, blew himself up like a ship in full sail, and bore straight down upon it; then he gobbled, and grew quite red in the face. The poor Duckling did not know where it should stand or walk; 206 it was quite melancholy, because it looked ugly and was scoffed at by the whole yard.\\n\\nSo it went on the first day; and afterward it became worse and worse. The poor Duckling was hunted about by every one; even its brothers and sisters were quite angry with it, and said, \"If the cat would only catch you, you ugly creature!\" And the mother said, \"If you were only far away!\" And the ducks bit it, and the chickens beat it, and the girl who had to feed the poultry kicked at it with her foot.\\n\\nThen it ran and flew over the fence, and the little birds in the bushes flew up in fear.\\n\\n\"That is because I am so ugly!\" thought the Duckling; and it shut its eyes, but flew no farther; thus it came out into the great moor, where the Wild Ducks lived. Here it lay the whole night long; and it was weary and downcast.\\n\\nToward morning the Wild Ducks flew up, and looked at their new companion.\\n\\n\"What sort of a one are you?\" they asked; and the Duckling turned in every direction, and bowed as well as it could. \"You are remarkably ugly!\" said the Wild Ducks. \"But that is very indifferent to us, so long as you do not marry into our family.\"\\n\\nPoor thing! It certainly did not think of marrying, and only hoped to obtain leave to lie among the reeds and drink some of the swamp-water.\\n\\nThus it lay two whole days; then came thither two Wild Geese, or, properly speaking, two wild ganders. It was not long since each had crept out of an egg, and that\\'s why they were so saucy.\\n\\n\"Listen, comrade,\" said one of them. \"You\\'re so ugly that I like you. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Near here, in another moor, there are a few sweet lovely wild geese, all unmarried, and all able to say, \\'Rap!\\' You\\'ve a chance of making your fortune, ugly as you are!\"\\n\\n\"Piff! paff!\" resounded through the air; and the two ganders fell down dead in the swamp, and the water became blood-red. \"Piff! paff!\" it sounded again, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the reeds. And then there was another report. A great hunt was going on. The hunters were lying in wait all round the moor, and some were even sitting up in the branches of the trees, which spread far over the reeds. The blue smoke rose up like clouds among the dark trees, and was wafted far away across the water; and the hunting dogs came—splash, splash!—into the swamp, and the rushes and the reeds bent down on every side. That was a fright for the poor Duckling! It turned its head, and put it under its wing; but at that moment a frightful great dog stood close by the Duckling. His tongue hung far out of his mouth and his eyes gleamed horrible and ugly; he thrust out his nose close against the Duckling, showed his sharp teeth, and—splash, splash!—on he went without seizing it.\\n\\n\"Oh, Heaven be thanked!\" sighed the Duckling. \"I am so ugly that even the dog does not like to bite me!\"\\n\\nAnd so it lay quite quiet, while the shots rattled through the reeds and gun after gun was fired. At last, late in the day, silence was restored; but the poor Duckling did not dare to rise up; it waited several hours before it looked round, and then hastened away out of the moor as fast as it could. It ran on over field and meadow; there was such a storm raging that it was difficult to get from one place to another. 207\\n\\nToward evening the Duck came to a little miserable peasant\\'s hut. This hut was so dilapidated that it did not know on which side it should fall; and that\\'s why it remained standing. The storm whistled round the Duckling in such a way that the poor creature was obliged to sit down, to stand against it; and the tempest grew worse and worse. Then the Duckling noticed that one of the hinges of the door had given way, and the door hung so slanting that the Duckling could slip through the crack into the room; and it did so.\\n\\nHere lived a woman with her Tom Cat and her Hen. And the Tom Cat, whom she called Sonnie, could arch his back and purr. He could even give out sparks; but for that one had to stroke his fur the wrong way. The Hen had quite little short legs, and therefore she was called Chickabiddy-shortshanks; she laid good eggs, and the woman loved her as her own child.\\n\\nIn the morning the strange Duckling was at once noticed, and the Tom Cat began to purr, and the Hen to cluck.\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\" said the woman, and looked all round; but she could not see well, and therefore she thought the Duckling was a fat duck that had strayed. \"This is a rare prize,\" she said. \"Now I shall have duck\\'s eggs. I hope it is not a drake. We must try that.\"\\n\\nAnd so the Duckling was admitted on trial for three weeks; but no eggs came. And the Tom Cat was master of the house, and the Hen was the lady, and they always said, \"We and the world!\" for they thought they were half the world, and by far the better half. The Duckling thought one might have a different opinion, but the Hen would not allow it.\\n\\n\"Can you lay eggs?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Then you\\'ll have the goodness to hold your tongue.\"\\n\\nAnd the Tom Cat said, \"Can you curve your back, and purr, and give out sparks?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Then you cannot have any opinion of your own when sensible people are speaking.\"\\n\\nAnd the Duckling sat in a corner and was melancholy; then the fresh air and the sunshine streamed in; and it was seized with such a strange longing to swim on the water that it could not help telling the Hen of it.\\n\\n\"What are you thinking of?\" cried the Hen. \"You have nothing to do; that\\'s why you have these fancies. Purr or lay eggs, and they will pass over.\"\\n\\n\"But it is so charming to swim on the water!\" said the Duckling, \"so refreshing to let it close above one\\'s head, and to dive down to the bottom.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that must be a mighty pleasure, truly,\" quoth the Hen. \"I fancy you must have gone crazy. Ask the Cat about it—he\\'s the cleverest animal I know—ask him if he likes to swim on the water, or to dive down: I won\\'t speak about myself. Ask our mistress, the old woman; no one in the world is cleverer than she. Do you think she has any desire to swim, and to let the water close above her head?\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t understand me,\" said the Duckling.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t understand you? Then pray who is to understand you? You surely don\\'t pretend to be cleverer than the Tom Cat and the old woman—I won\\'t say anything of myself. Don\\'t be conceited, child, and be grateful for all the kindness you have received. Did 208 you not get into a warm room, and have you not fallen into company from which you may learn something? But you are a chatterer, and it is not pleasant to associate with you. You may believe me, I speak for your good. I tell you disagreeable things, and by that one may always know one\\'s true friends. Only take care that you learn to lay eggs, or to purr and give out sparks!\"\\n\\n\"I think I will go out into the wide world,\" said the Duckling.\\n\\n\"Yes, do go,\" replied the Hen.\\n\\nAnd the Duckling went away. It swam on the water, and dived, but it was slighted by every creature because of its ugliness.\\n\\nNow came the autumn. The leaves in the forest turned yellow and brown; the wind caught them so that they danced about, and up in the air it was very cold. The clouds hung low, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, and on the fence stood the raven, crying, \"Croak! croak!\" for mere cold; yes, it was enough to make one feel cold to think of this. The poor little Duckling certainly had not a good time. One evening—the sun was just setting in his beauty—there came a whole flock of great handsome birds out of the bushes; they were dazzlingly white, with long flexible necks; they were swans. They uttered a very peculiar cry, spread forth their glorious great wings, and flew away from that cold region to warmer lands, to fair open lakes. They mounted so high, so high! and the ugly little Duckling felt quite strange as it watched them. It turned round and round in the water like a wheel, stretched out its neck toward them, and uttered such a strange loud cry as frightened itself. Oh! it could not forget those beautiful, happy birds; and so soon as it could see them no longer, it dived down to the very bottom, and when it came up again, it was quite beside itself. It knew not the name of those birds, and knew not whither they were flying; but it loved them more than it had ever loved anyone. It was not at all envious of them. How could it think of wishing to possess such loveliness as they had? It would have been glad if only the ducks would have endured its company—the poor ugly creature!\\n\\nAnd the winter grew cold, very cold! The Duckling was forced to swim about in the water, to prevent the surface from freezing entirely; but every night the hole in which it swam about became smaller and smaller. It froze so hard that the icy covering crackled again; and the Duckling was obliged to use its legs continually to prevent the hole from freezing up. At last it became exhausted, and lay quite still, and thus froze fast into the ice.\\n\\nEarly in the morning a peasant came by, and when he saw what had happened, he took his wooden shoe, broke the ice-crust to pieces, and carried the Duckling home to his wife. Then it came to itself again. The children wanted to play with it; but the Duckling thought they would do it an injury, and in its terror fluttered up into the milk-pan, so that the milk spurted down into the room. The woman clapped her hands, at which the Duckling flew down into the butter-tub, and then into the meal-barrel and out again. How it looked then! The woman screamed, and struck at it with the fire-tongs; the children tumbled over one another in their efforts to catch the Duckling; and they laughed and screamed finely. Happily the door stood open, and the poor creature was able to slip out between the shrubs into the newly- 209fallen snow; and there it lay quite exhausted.\\n\\nBut it would be too melancholy if I were to tell all the misery and care which the Duckling had to endure in the hard winter. It lay out on the moor among the reeds when the sun began to shine again and the larks to sing; it was a beautiful spring.\\n\\nThen all at once the Duckling could flap its wings; they beat the air more strongly than before, and bore it strongly away; and before it well knew how all this had happened, it found itself in a great garden, where the elder trees smelt sweet, and bent their long green branches down to the canal that wound through the region. Oh, here it was so beautiful, such a gladness of spring! and from the thicket came three glorious white swans; they rustled their wings, and swam lightly on the water. The Duckling knew the splendid creatures, and felt oppressed by a peculiar sadness.\\n\\n\"I will fly away to them, to the royal birds! and they will kill me, because I, that am so ugly, dare to approach them. But it is of no consequence! Better to be killed by them than to be pursued by ducks, and beaten by fowls, and pushed about by the girl who takes care of the poultry-yard, and to suffer hunger in winter!\" And it flew out into the water, and swam toward the beautiful swans: these looked at it, and came sailing down upon it with outspread wings. \"Kill me!\" said the poor creature, and bent its head down upon the water, expecting nothing but death. But what was this that it saw in the clear water? It beheld its own image—and, lo! it was no longer a clumsy dark-gray bird, ugly and hateful to look at, but—a swan.\\n\\nIt matters nothing if one was born in a duck-yard, if one has only lain in a swan\\'s egg.\\n\\nIt felt quite glad at all the need and misfortune it had suffered, now it realized its happiness in all the splendor that surrounded it. And the great swans swam round it, and stroked it with their beaks.\\n\\nInto the garden came little children, who threw bread and corn into the water; the youngest cried, \"There is a new one!\" and the other children shouted joyously, \"Yes, a new one has arrived!\" And they clapped their hands and danced about, and ran to their father and mother; and bread and cake were thrown into the water; and they all said, \"The new one is the most beautiful of all! so young and handsome!\" and the old swans bowed their heads before him.\\n\\nThen he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing, for he did not know what to do; he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He thought how he had been persecuted and despised; and now he heard them saying that he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder tree bent its branches straight down into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and mild. Then his wings rustled, he lifted his slender neck, and cried rejoicingly from the depths of his heart:\\n\\n\"I never dreamed of so much happiness when I was still the Ugly Duckling!\"\\n\\n199\\n\\nOne of the really successful modern attempts at telling new fairy stories was Granny\\'s Wonderful Chair (1857) by the blind poet Frances Browne (1816-1887). In spite of the obstacles due to blindness, poverty, and ill-health, she succeeded in educating herself, and after achieving some fame as a poet left her mountain village 210 in county Donegal, Ireland, to make a literary career in Edinburgh and London. She published many volumes of poems, novels, and children\\'s books. Only one of these is now much read or remembered, but it has taken a firm place in the affections of children. In Granny\\'s Wonderful Chair there are seven stories, set in an interesting framework which tells of the adventures of the little girl Snowflower and her chair at the court of King Winwealth. This chair had magic power to transport Snowflower wherever she wished to go, like the magic carpet in the Arabian Nights. When she laid down her head and said, \"Chair of my grandmother, tell me a story,\" a clear voice from under the cushion would at once begin to speak. Besides the story that follows, two of the most satisfactory in the collection are \"The Greedy Shepherd\" and \"The Story of Merrymind.\" Perhaps one of the secrets of their charm is in the power of visualization which the author possessed. The pictures are all clear and definite, yet touched with the glamor of fairyland.\\n\\nTHE STORY OF FAIRYFOOT\\n\\nFRANCES BROWNE\\n\\nOnce upon a time there stood far away in the west country a town called Stumpinghame. It contained seven windmills, a royal palace, a market place, and a prison, with every other convenience befitting the capital of a kingdom. A capital city was Stumpinghame, and its inhabitants thought it the only one in the world. It stood in the midst of a great plain, which for three leagues round its walls was covered with corn, flax, and orchards. Beyond that lay a great circle of pasture land, seven leagues in breadth, and it was bounded on all sides by a forest so thick and old that no man in Stumpinghame knew its extent; and the opinion of the learned was that it reached to the end of the world.\\n\\nThere were strong reasons for this opinion. First, that forest was known to be inhabited time out of mind by the fairies, and no hunter cared to go beyond its border—so all the west country believed it to be solidly full of old trees to the heart. Secondly, the people of Stumpinghame were no travelers—man, woman, and child had feet so large and heavy that it was by no means convenient to carry them far. Whether it was the nature of the place or the people, I cannot tell, but great feet had been the fashion there time immemorial, and the higher the family the larger were they. It was, therefore, the aim of everybody above the degree of shepherds, and such-like rustics, to swell out and enlarge their feet by way of gentility; and so successful were they in these undertakings that, on a pinch, respectable people\\'s slippers would have served for panniers.\\n\\nStumpinghame had a king of its own, and his name was Stiffstep; his family was very ancient and large-footed. His subjects called him Lord of the World, and he made a speech to them every year concerning the grandeur of his mighty empire. His queen, Hammerheel, was the greatest beauty in Stumpinghame. Her majesty\\'s shoe was not much less than a fishing-boat; their six children promised to be quite as handsome, and all went well with them till the birth of their seventh son.\\n\\nFor a long time nobody about the palace could understand what was the matter—the ladies-in-waiting looked so astonished, and the king so vexed; but at last it was whispered through the city that the queen\\'s seventh child had been born with such miserably small feet that 211 they resembled nothing ever seen or heard of in Stumpinghame, except the feet of the fairies.\\n\\nThe chronicles furnished no example of such an affliction ever before happening in the royal family. The common people thought it portended some great calamity to the city; the learnèd men began to write books about it; and all the relations of the king and queen assembled at the palace to mourn with them over their singular misfortune. The whole court and most of the citizens helped in this mourning, but when it had lasted seven days they all found out it was of no use. So the relations went to their homes, and the people took to their work. If the learnèd men\\'s books were written, nobody ever read them; and to cheer up the queen\\'s spirits, the young prince was sent privately out to the pasture lands, to be nursed among the shepherds.\\n\\nThe chief man there was called Fleecefold, and his wife\\'s name was Rough Ruddy. They lived in a snug cottage with their son Blackthorn and their daughter Brownberry, and were thought great people, because they kept the king\\'s sheep. Moreover, Fleecefold\\'s family were known to be ancient; and Rough Ruddy boasted that she had the largest feet in all the pastures. The shepherds held them in high respect, and it grew still higher when the news spread that the king\\'s seventh son had been sent to their cottage. People came from all quarters to see the young prince, and great were the lamentations over his misfortune in having such small feet.\\n\\nThe king and queen had given him fourteen names, beginning with Augustus—such being the fashion in that royal family; but the honest country people could not remember so many; besides, his feet were the most remarkable thing about the child, so with one accord they called him Fairyfoot. At first it was feared this might be high treason, but when no notice was taken by the king or his ministers, the shepherds concluded it was no harm, and the boy never had another name throughout the pastures. At court it was not thought polite to speak of him at all. They did not keep his birthday, and he was never sent for at Christmas, because the queen and her ladies could not bear the sight. Once a year the undermost scullion was sent to see how he did, with a bundle of his next brother\\'s cast-off clothes; and, as the king grew old and cross, it was said he had thoughts of disowning him.\\n\\nSo Fairyfoot grew in Fleecefold\\'s cottage. Perhaps the country air made him fair and rosy—for all agreed that he would have been a handsome boy but for his small feet, with which nevertheless he learned to walk, and in time to run and to jump, thereby amazing everybody, for such doings were not known among the children of Stumpinghame. The news of court, however, traveled to the shepherds, and Fairyfoot was despised among them. The old people thought him unlucky; the children refused to play with him. Fleecefold was ashamed to have him in his cottage, but he durst not disobey the king\\'s orders. Moreover, Blackthorn wore most of the clothes brought by the scullion. At last, Rough Ruddy found out that the sight of such horrid jumping would make her children vulgar; and, as soon as he was old enough, she sent Fairyfoot every day to watch some sickly sheep that grazed on a wild, weedy pasture, hard by the forest.\\n\\nPoor Fairyfoot was often lonely and sorrowful; many a time he wished his feet would grow larger, or that people wouldn\\'t notice them so much; and all the comfort he had was running and jumping by himself in the wild pasture, and thinking that none of the shepherds\\' children could do the like, for all their pride of their great feet.\\n\\nTired of this sport, he was lying in the shadow of a mossy rock one warm summer\\'s noon, with the sheep feeding around, when a robin, pursued by a great hawk, flew into the old velvet cap which lay on the ground beside him. Fairyfoot covered it up, and the hawk, frightened by his shout, flew away.\\n\\n\"Now you may go, poor robin!\" he said, opening the cap: but instead of the bird, out sprang a little man dressed in russet-brown, and looking as if he were an hundred years old. Fairyfoot could not speak for astonishment, but the little man said—\\n\\n\"Thank you for your shelter, and be sure I will do as much for you. Call on me if you are ever in trouble; my name is Robin Goodfellow\"; and darting off, he was out of sight in an instant. For days the boy wondered who that little man could be, but he told nobody, for the little man\\'s feet were as small as his own, and it was clear he would be no favorite in Stumpinghame. Fairyfoot kept the story to himself, and at last midsummer came. That evening was a feast among the shepherds. There were bonfires on the hills, and fun in the villages. But Fairyfoot sat alone beside his sheepfold, for the children of his village had refused to let him dance with them about the bonfire, and he had gone there to bewail the size of his feet, which came between him and so many good things. Fairyfoot had never felt so lonely in all his life, and remembering the little man, he plucked up spirit, and cried—\\n\\n\"Ho! Robin Goodfellow!\"\\n\\n\"Here I am,\" said a shrill voice at his elbow; and there stood the little man himself.\\n\\n\"I am very lonely, and no one will play with me, because my feet are not large enough,\" said Fairyfoot.\\n\\n\"Come then and play with us,\" said the little man. \"We lead the merriest lives in the world, and care for nobody\\'s feet; but all companies have their own manners, and there are two things you must mind among us: first, do as you see the rest doing; and secondly, never speak of anything you may hear or see, for we and the people of this country have had no friendship ever since large feet came in fashion.\"\\n\\n\"I will do that, and anything more you like,\" said Fairyfoot; and the little man, taking his hand, led him over the pasture into the forest and along a mossy path among old trees wreathed with ivy (he never knew how far), till they heard the sound of music and came upon a meadow where the moon shone as bright as day, and all the flowers of the year—snowdrops, violets, primroses, and cowslips—bloomed together in the thick grass. There were a crowd of little men and women, some clad in russet color, but far more in green, dancing round a little well as clear as crystal. And under great rose-trees which grew here and there in the meadow, companies were sitting round low tables covered with cups of milk, dishes of honey, and carved wooden flagons filled with clear red wine. The little man led Fairyfoot up to the nearest table, handed him one of the flagons, and said 213—\\n\\n\"Drink to the good company.\"\\n\\nWine was not very common among the shepherds of Stumpinghame, and the boy had never tasted such drink as that before; for scarcely had it gone down when he forgot all his troubles—how Blackthorn and Brownberry wore his clothes, how Rough Ruddy sent him to keep the sickly sheep, and the children would not dance with him: in short, he forgot the whole misfortune of his feet, and it seemed to his mind that he was a king\\'s son, and all was well with him. All the little people about the well cried—\"Welcome! welcome!\" and every one said—\"Come and dance with me!\" So Fairyfoot was as happy as a prince, and drank milk and ate honey till the moon was low in the sky, and then the little man took him by the hand, and never stopped nor stayed till he was at his own bed of straw in the cottage corner.\\n\\nNext morning Fairyfoot was not tired for all his dancing. Nobody in the cottage had missed him, and he went out with the sheep as usual; but every night all that summer, when the shepherds were safe in bed, the little man came and took him away to dance in the forest. Now he did not care to play with the shepherds\\' children, nor grieve that his father and mother had forgotten him, but watched the sheep all day, singing to himself or plaiting rushes; and when the sun went down, Fairyfoot\\'s heart rejoiced at the thought of meeting that merry company.\\n\\nThe wonder was that he was never tired nor sleepy, as people are apt to be who dance all night; but before the summer was ended Fairyfoot found out the reason. One night, when the moon was full, and the last of the ripe corn rustling in the fields, Robin Goodfellow came for him as usual, and away they went to the flowery green. The fun there was high, and Robin was in haste. So he only pointed to the carved cup from which Fairyfoot every night drank the clear red wine.\\n\\n\"I am not thirsty, and there is no use losing time,\" thought the boy to himself, and he joined the dance; but never in all his life did Fairyfoot find such hard work as to keep pace with the company. Their feet seemed to move like lightning, the swallows did not fly so fast or turn so quickly. Fairyfoot did his best, for he never gave in easily, but at length, his breath and strength being spent, the boy was glad to steal away and sit down behind a mossy oak, where his eyes closed for very weariness. When he awoke the dance was nearly over, but two little ladies clad in green talked close beside him.\\n\\n\"What a beautiful boy!\" said one of them. \"He is worthy to be a king\\'s son. Only see what handsome feet he has!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the other, with a laugh, that sounded spiteful; \"they are just like the feet Princess Maybloom had before she washed them in the Growing Well. Her father has sent far and wide throughout the whole country searching for a doctor to make them small again, but nothing in this world can do it except the water of the Fair Fountain, and none but I and the nightingales know where it is.\"\\n\\n\"One would not care to let the like be known,\" said the first little lady: \"there would come such crowds of these great coarse creatures of mankind, nobody would have peace for leagues round. But you will surely send word to the sweet princess!—she was so kind to our birds and butterflies, and danced so like one of ourselves!\" 214\\n\\n\"Not I, indeed!\" said the spiteful fairy. \"Her old skinflint of a father cut down the cedar which I loved best in the whole forest, and made a chest of it to hold his money in; besides, I never liked the princess—everybody praised her so. But come, we shall be too late for the last dance.\"\\n\\nWhen they were gone, Fairyfoot could sleep no more with astonishment. He did not wonder at the fairies admiring his feet, because their own were much the same; but it amazed him that Princess Maybloom\\'s father should be troubled at hers growing large. Moreover, he wished to see that same princess and her country, since there were really other places in the world than Stumpinghame.\\n\\nWhen Robin Goodfellow came to take him home as usual he durst not let him know that he had overheard anything; but never was the boy so unwilling to get up as on that morning, and all day he was so weary that in the afternoon Fairyfoot fell asleep, with his head on a clump of rushes. It was seldom that any one thought of looking after him and the sickly sheep; but it so happened that towards evening the old shepherd, Fleecefold, thought he would see how things went on in the pastures. The shepherd had a bad temper and a thick staff, and no sooner did he catch sight of Fairyfoot sleeping, and his flock straying away, than shouting all the ill names he could remember, in a voice which woke up the boy, he ran after him as fast as his great feet would allow; while Fairyfoot, seeing no other shelter from his fury, fled into the forest, and never stopped nor stayed till he reached the banks of a little stream.\\n\\nThinking it might lead him to the fairies\\' dancing-ground, he followed that stream for many an hour, but it wound away into the heart of the forest, flowing through dells, falling over mossy rocks, and at last leading Fairyfoot, when he was tired and the night had fallen, to a grove of great rose-trees, with the moon shining on it as bright as day, and thousands of nightingales singing in the branches. In the midst of that grove was a clear spring, bordered with banks of lilies, and Fairyfoot sat down by it to rest himself and listen. The singing was so sweet he could have listened for ever, but as he sat the nightingales left off their songs, and began to talk together in the silence of the night.\\n\\n\"What boy is that,\" said one on a branch above him, \"who sits so lonely by the Fair Fountain? He cannot have come from Stumpinghame with such small and handsome feet.\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ll warrant you,\" said another, \"he has come from the west country. How in the world did he find the way?\"\\n\\n\"How simple you are!\" said a third nightingale. \"What had he to do but follow the ground-ivy which grows over height and hollow, bank and bush, from the lowest gate of the king\\'s kitchen garden to the root of this rose-tree? He looks a wise boy, and I hope he will keep the secret, or we shall have all the west country here, dabbling in our fountain, and leaving us no rest to either talk or sing.\"\\n\\nFairyfoot sat in great astonishment at this discourse, but by and by, when the talk ceased and the songs began, he thought it might be as well for him to follow the ground-ivy, and see the Princess Maybloom, not to speak of getting rid of Rough Ruddy, the sickly sheep, and the crusty old shepherd. It 215 was a long journey; but he went on, eating wild berries by day, sleeping in the hollows of old trees by night, and never losing sight of the ground-ivy, which led him over height and hollow, bank and bush, out of the forest, and along a noble high road, with fields and villages on every side, to a great city, and a low old-fashioned gate of the king\\'s kitchen-garden, which was thought too mean for the scullions, and had not been opened for seven years.\\n\\nThere was no use knocking—the gate was overgrown with tall weeds and moss; so, being an active boy, he climbed over, and walked through the garden, till a white fawn came frisking by, and he heard a soft voice saying sorrowfully—\\n\\n\"Come back, come back, my fawn! I cannot run and play with you now, my feet have grown so heavy\"; and looking round he saw the loveliest young princess in the world, dressed in snow-white, and wearing a wreath of roses on her golden hair; but walking slowly, as the great people did in Stumpinghame, for her feet were as large as the best of them.\\n\\nAfter her came six young ladies, dressed in white and walking slowly, for they could not go before the princess; but Fairyfoot was amazed to see that their feet were as small as his own. At once he guessed that this must be the Princess Maybloom, and made her an humble bow, saying—\\n\\n\"Royal princess, I have heard of your trouble because your feet have grown large; in my country that\\'s all the fashion. For seven years past I have been wondering what would make mine grow, to no purpose; but I know of a certain fountain that will make yours smaller and finer than ever they were, if the king, your father, gives you leave to come with me, accompanied by two of your maids that are the least given to talking, and the most prudent officer in all his household; for it would grievously offend the fairies and the nightingales to make that fountain known.\"\\n\\nWhen the princess heard that, she danced for joy in spite of her large feet, and she and her six maids brought Fairyfoot before the king and queen, where they sat in their palace hall, with all the courtiers paying their morning compliments. The lords were very much astonished to see a ragged, bare-footed boy brought in among them, and the ladies thought Princess Maybloom must have gone mad; but Fairyfoot, making an humble reverence, told his message to the king and queen, and offered to set out with the princess that very day. At first the king would not believe that there could be any use in his offer, because so many great physicians had failed to give any relief. The courtiers laughed Fairyfoot to scorn, the pages wanted to turn him out for an impudent impostor, and the prime minister said he ought to be put to death for high treason.\\n\\nFairyfoot wished himself safe in the forest again, or even keeping the sickly sheep; but the queen, being a prudent woman, said—\\n\\n\"I pray your majesty to notice what fine feet this boy has. There may be some truth in his story. For the sake of our only daughter, I will choose two maids who talk the least of all our train, and my chamberlain, who is the most discreet officer in our household. Let them go with the princess; who knows but our sorrow may be lessened?\"\\n\\nAfter some persuasion the king consented, though all his councillors advised 216 the contrary. So the two silent maids, the discreet chamberlain, and her fawn, which would not stay behind, were sent with Princess Maybloom, and they all set out after dinner. Fairyfoot had hard work guiding them along the track of the ground-ivy. The maids and the chamberlain did not like the brambles and rough roots of the forest—they thought it hard to eat berries and sleep in hollow trees; but the princess went on with good courage, and at last they reached the grove of rose-trees, and the spring bordered with lilies.\\n\\nThe chamberlain washed—and though his hair had been grey, and his face wrinkled, the young courtiers envied his beauty for years after. The maids washed—and from that day they were esteemed the fairest in all the palace. Lastly, the princess washed also—it could make her no fairer, but the moment her feet touched the water they grew less, and when she had washed and dried them three times, they were as small and finely-shaped as Fairyfoot\\'s own. There was great joy among them, but the boy said sorrowfully—\\n\\n\"Oh! if there had been a well in the world to make my feet large, my father and mother would not have cast me off, nor sent me to live among the shepherds.\"\\n\\n\"Cheer up your heart,\" said the Princess Maybloom; \"if you want large feet, there is a well in this forest that will do it. Last summer time I came with my father and his foresters to see a great cedar cut down, of which he meant to make a money chest. While they were busy with the cedar, I saw a bramble branch covered with berries. Some were ripe and some were green, but it was the longest bramble that ever grew; for the sake of the berries, I went on and on to its root, which grew hard by a muddy-looking well, with banks of dark green moss, in the deepest part of the forest. The day was warm and dry and my feet were sore with the rough ground, so I took off my scarlet shoes and washed my feet in the well; but as I washed they grew larger every minute, and nothing could ever make them less again. I have seen the bramble this day; it is not far off, and as you have shown me the Fair Fountain, I will show you the Growing Well.\"\\n\\nUp rose Fairyfoot and Princess Maybloom, and went together till they found the bramble, and came to where its root grew, hard by the muddy-looking well, with banks of dark green moss in the deepest dell of the forest. Fairyfoot sat down to wash, but at that minute he heard a sound of music, and knew it was the fairies going to their dancing ground.\\n\\n\"If my feet grow large,\" said the boy to himself, \"how shall I dance with them?\" So, rising quickly, he took the Princess Maybloom by the hand. The fawn followed them; the maids and the chamberlain followed it, and all followed the music through the forest. At last they came to the flowery green. Robin Goodfellow welcomed the company for Fairyfoot\\'s sake, and gave every one a drink of the fairies\\' wine. So they danced there from sunset till the grey morning, and nobody was tired; but before the lark sang, Robin Goodfellow took them all safe home, as he used to take Fairyfoot.\\n\\nThere was great joy that day in the palace because Princess Maybloom\\'s feet were made small again. The king gave Fairyfoot all manner of fine clothes and rich jewels; and when they heard his wonderful story, he and the queen asked 217 him to live with them and be their son. In process of time Fairyfoot and Princess Maybloom were married, and still live happily. When they go to visit at Stumpinghame, they always wash their feet in the Growing Well, lest the royal family might think them a disgrace, but when they come back, they make haste to the Fair Fountain; and the fairies and the nightingales are great friends to them, as well as the maids and the chamberlain, because they have told nobody about it, and there is peace and quiet yet in the grove of rose-trees.\\n\\n200\\n\\nThe ill-fated Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) was born in Ireland, was educated at Oxford, came into great notoriety as the reputed leader of the \"aesthetic movement,\" was prominent in the London literary world from 1885 to 1895, fell under the obloquy of most of his countrymen, and died in distressing circumstances in Paris. In addition to some remarkable plays, poems, and prose books, he wrote a number of unusual stories especially fascinating to children, which were collected under the title The Happy Prince, and Other Tales. These stories were at once recognized as classic in quality. While they contain much implied criticism of certain features of modern civilization, the whole tone is so idealistic and the workmanship so fine that they convey no strong note of bitterness to the child. \"The Happy Prince\" suggests that Wilde saw on the one hand \"the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets\"; while on the other hand he saw the Pyramids, marble angels sculptured on the cathedral tower, and the gold-covered statue of the Prince of the Palace of the Care-Free. Wilde also suggests a remedy for the starvation and wretchedness that exist, especially among children, in most cities where great wealth is displayed. The important thing in presenting this story to children is to get the full sympathetic response due to the sacrifice made by the Happy Prince and the little swallow. So much of the effect depends upon the wonderful beauty of the language that teachers will, as a rule, get better results from reading or reciting than from any kind of oral paraphrase. Another story in this same volume widely and successfully used by teachers is the one called \"The Selfish Giant.\"\\n\\nTHE HAPPY PRINCE\\n\\nOSCAR WILDE\\n\\nHigh above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.\\n\\nHe was very much admired indeed. \"He is as beautiful as a weathercock,\" remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; \"only not quite so useful,\" he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\\n\\n\"Why can\\'t you be like the Happy Prince?\" asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon. \"The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,\" muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\\n\\n\"He looks just like an angel,\" said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores.\\n\\n\"How do you know?\" said the Mathematical Master; \"you have never seen one.\" 218\\n\\n\"Ah! but we have, in our dreams,\" answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.\\n\\nOne night there flew over the city a Little Swallow. His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\\n\\n\"Shall I love you?\" said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\\n\\n\"It is a ridiculous attachment,\" twittered the other Swallows; \"she has no money, and far too many relations\"; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. Then when the autumn came they all flew away.\\n\\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. \"She has no conversation,\" he said, \"and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.\" And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. \"I admit that she is domestic,\" he continued, \"but I love traveling, and my wife, consequently, should love traveling also.\"\\n\\n\"Will you come away with me?\" he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home.\\n\\n\"You have been trifling with me,\" he cried. \"I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye!\" and he flew away.\\n\\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. \"Where shall I put up?\" he said; \"I hope the town has made preparations.\"\\n\\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\\n\\n\"I will put up there,\" he cried; \"it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.\" So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\\n\\n\"I have a golden bedroom,\" he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. \"What a curious thing!\" he cried; \"there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.\"\\n\\nThen another drop fell.\\n\\n\"What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?\" he said; \"I must look for a good chimney-pot,\" and he determined to fly away.\\n\\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw—Ah! what did he see?\\n\\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\\n\\n\"Who are you?\" he said.\\n\\n\"I am the Happy Prince.\"\\n\\n\"Why are you weeping then?\" asked the Swallow; \"you have quite drenched me.\"\\n\\n\"When I was alive and had a human heart,\" answered the statue, \"I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. In the daytime I 219 played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose but weep.\"\\n\\n\"What! is he not solid gold?\" said the Swallow to himself. He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud.\\n\\n\"Far away,\" continued the statue in a low musical voice, \"far away in a little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen\\'s maids-of-honor to wear at the next Court-ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not take her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.\"\\n\\n\"I am waited for in Egypt,\" said the Swallow. \"My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.\"\\n\\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I like boys,\" answered the Swallow. \"Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller\\'s sons, who were always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.\"\\n\\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. \"It is very cold here,\" he said; \"but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, little Swallow,\" said the Prince.\\n\\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince\\'s sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\\n\\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. \"How wonderful the stars are,\" he said to her, \"and how wonderful is the power of love!\"\\n\\n\"I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,\" she answered; \"I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.\"\\n\\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships. He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each 220 other, and weighing out money in copper scales. At last he came to the poor house and looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman\\'s thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy\\'s forehead with his wings. \"How cool I feel,\" said the boy. \"I must be getting better\"; and he sank into a delicious slumber.\\n\\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. \"It is curious,\" he remarked, \"but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.\"\\n\\n\"That is because you have done a good action,\" said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.\\n\\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath. \"What a remarkable phenomenon,\" said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. \"A swallow in winter!\" And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.\\n\\n\"To-night I go to Egypt,\" said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, \"What a distinguished stranger!\" so he enjoyed himself very much.\\n\\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. \"Have you any commissions for Egypt?\" he cried; \"I am just starting.\"\\n\\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"will you not stay with me one night longer?\"\\n\\n\"I am waited for in Egypt,\" answered the Swallow. \"To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract. The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon. All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent. At noon the yellow lions come down to the water\\'s edge to drink. They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.\"\\n\\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"far away across the city I see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.\"\\n\\n\"I will wait with you one night longer,\" said the Swallow, who really had a good heart. \"Shall I take him another ruby?\"\\n\\n\"Alas! I have no ruby now,\" said the Prince; \"my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Prince,\" said the Swallow, \"I cannot do that\"; and he began to weep.\\n\\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"do as I command you.\"\\n\\nSo the Swallow plucked out the 221 Prince\\'s eye, and flew away to the student\\'s garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird\\'s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.\\n\\n\"I am beginning to be appreciated,\" he cried; \"this is from some great admirer. Now I can finish my play,\" and he looked quite happy.\\n\\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbor. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. \"Heave a-hoy!\" they shouted as each chest came up. \"I am going to Egypt!\" cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\\n\\n\"I am come to bid you good-bye,\" he cried.\\n\\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"will you not stay with me one night longer?\"\\n\\n\"It is winter,\" answered the Swallow, \"and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.\"\\n\\n\"In the square below,\" said the Happy Prince, \"there stands a little match-girl. She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.\"\\n\\n\"I will stay with you one night longer,\" said the Swallow, \"but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be quite blind then.\"\\n\\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"do as I command you.\"\\n\\nSo he plucked out the Prince\\'s other eye, and darted down with it. He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand. \"What a lovely bit of glass,\" cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.\\n\\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince. \"You are blind now,\" he said, \"so I will stay with you always.\"\\n\\n\"No, little Swallow,\" said the poor Prince, \"you must go away to Egypt.\"\\n\\n\"I will stay with you always,\" said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince\\'s feet.\\n\\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince\\'s shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch goldfish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat 222 leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.\\n\\n\"Dear little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"you tell me of marvelous things, but more marvelous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.\"\\n\\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another\\'s arms to try to keep themselves warm. \"How hungry we are!\" they said. \"You must not lie here,\" shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\\n\\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\\n\\n\"I am covered with fine gold,\" said the Prince; \"you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.\"\\n\\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children\\'s faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street. \"We have bread now!\" they cried.\\n\\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.\\n\\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince; he loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the baker\\'s door when the baker was not looking, and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.\\n\\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince\\'s shoulder once more. \"Good-bye, dear Prince!\" he murmured, \"will you let me kiss your hand?\"\\n\\n\"I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,\" said the Prince. \"You have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.\"\\n\\n\"It is not to Egypt that I am going,\" said the Swallow. \"I am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?\"\\n\\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.\\n\\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had suddenly broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\\n\\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: \"Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!\" he said.\\n\\n\"How shabby indeed!\" cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\\n\\n\"The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,\" said the Mayor; \"in fact, he is little better than a beggar!\"\\n\\n\"Little better than a beggar,\" said the Town Councillors.\\n\\n\"And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!\" continued the Mayor. \"We 223 must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.\" And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\\n\\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. \"As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,\" said the Art Professor at the University.\\n\\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. \"We must have another statue, of course,\" he said, \"and it shall be a statue of myself.\"\\n\\n\"Of myself,\" said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled. When I last heard of them they were quarreling still.\\n\\n\"What a strange thing!\" said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. \"This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away.\" So they threw it on a dustheap where the dead Swallow was also lying.\\n\\n\"Bring me the two most precious things in the city,\" said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\\n\\n\"You have rightly chosen,\" said God, \"for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.\"\\n\\n201\\n\\nTwo stories of unusual interest and charm for children are found in the collection of eleven by Raymond M. Alden (1873—), Why the Chimes Rang. One is the title story of the volume; the other is \"The Knights of the Silver Shield.\" The latter follows by permission of the publishers, The Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis. (Copyright, 1906, 1908.) It is of striking dramatic interest and emphasizes a much-needed quality of character, the importance of a loyal performance of the lowlier duties of life. The salvation of a nation may depend upon the humble guardian of the gate quite as much as upon those who are engaged in the more spectacular struggle with giants. Mr. Alden is a scholarly professor of literature in Leland Stanford Jr. University, and it may interest the reader to know that he is the son of the author of the Pansy Books, a type of religious or Sunday-school fiction widely read throughout the country by a generation or two of young people.\\n\\nTHE KNIGHTS OF THE SILVER SHIELD\\n\\nRAYMOND MACDONALD ALDEN\\n\\nThere was once a splendid castle in a forest, with great stone walls and a high gateway, and turrets that rose away above the tallest trees. The forest was dark and dangerous, and many cruel giants lived in it; but in the castle was a company of knights, who were kept there by the king of the country, to help travelers who might be in the forest and to fight with the giants whenever they could.\\n\\nEach of these knights wore a beautiful suit of armor and carried a long spear, while over his helmet there floated a great red plume that could be seen a long way off by any one in distress. But the most wonderful thing about the knights\\' armor was their shields. They were not like those of other knights, but had been made by a great magician who had lived in the castle many years before. They were made of silver, and sometimes shone in the sunlight with dazzling brightness; but at other times the surface of the shields would be clouded as though by a mist, and one could not see his face 224 reflected there as he could when they shone brightly.\\n\\nNow, when each young knight received his spurs and his armor, a new shield was also given him from among those that the magician had made; and when the shield was new its surface was always cloudy and dull. But as the knight began to do service against the giants, or went on expeditions to help poor travelers in the forest, his shield grew brighter and brighter, so that he could see his face clearly reflected in it. But if he proved to be a lazy or cowardly knight, and let the giants get the better of him, or did not care what became of the travelers, then the shield grew more and more cloudy, until the knight became ashamed to carry it.\\n\\nBut this was not all. When any one of the knights fought a particularly hard battle, and won the victory, or when he went on some hard errand for the lord of the castle, and was successful, not only did his silver shield grow brighter, but when one looked into the center of it he could see something like a golden star shining in its very heart. This was the greatest honor that a knight could achieve, and the other knights always spoke of such a one as having \"won his star.\" It was usually not till he was pretty old and tried as a soldier that he could win it. At the time when this story begins, the lord of the castle himself was the only one of the knights whose shield bore the golden star.\\n\\nThere came a time when the worst of the giants in the forest gathered themselves together to have a battle against the knights. They made a camp in a dark hollow not far from the castle, and gathered all their best warriors together, and all the knights made ready to fight them. The windows of the castle were closed and barred; the air was full of the noise of armor being made ready for use; and the knights were so excited that they could scarcely rest or eat.\\n\\nNow there was a young knight in the castle, named Sir Roland, who was among those most eager for the battle. He was a splendid warrior, with eyes that shone like stars whenever there was anything to do in the way of knightly deeds. And although he was still quite young, his shield had begun to shine enough to show plainly that he had done bravely in some of his errands through the forest. This battle, he thought, would be the great opportunity of his life. And on the morning of the day when they were to go forth to it, and all the knights assembled in the great hall of the castle to receive the commands of their leaders, Sir Roland hoped that he would be put in the most dangerous place of all, so that he could show what knightly stuff he was made of.\\n\\nBut when the lord of the castle came to him, as he went about in full armor giving his commands, he said: \"One brave knight must stay behind and guard the gateway of the castle, and it is you, Sir Roland, being one of the youngest, whom I have chosen for this.\"\\n\\nAt these words Sir Roland was so disappointed that he bit his lip and closed his helmet over his face so that the other knights might not see it. For a moment he felt as if he must reply angrily to the commander and tell him that it was not right to leave so sturdy a knight behind when he was eager to fight. But he struggled against this feeling and went quietly to look after his duties at the gate. The gateway was high and narrow, and was reached from outside by a high, narrow bridge that crossed the moat, which 225 surrounded the castle on every side. When an enemy approached, the knight on guard rang a great bell just inside the gate, and the bridge was drawn up against the castle wall, so that no one could come across the moat. So the giants had long ago given up trying to attack the castle itself.\\n\\nTo-day the battle was to be in the dark hollow in the forest, and it was not likely that there would be anything to do at the castle gate, except to watch it like a common doorkeeper. It was not strange that Sir Roland thought some one else might have done this.\\n\\nPresently all the other knights marched out in their flashing armor, their red plumes waving over their heads, and their spears in their hands. The lord of the castle stopped only to tell Sir Roland to keep guard over the gate until they had all returned and to let no one enter. Then they went into the shadows of the forest and were soon lost to sight.\\n\\nSir Roland stood looking after them long after they had gone, thinking how happy he would be if he were on the way to battle like them. But after a little he put this out of his mind and tried to think of pleasanter things. It was a long time before anything happened, or any word came from the battle.\\n\\nAt last Sir Roland saw one of the knights come limping down the path to the castle, and he went out on the bridge to meet him. Now this knight was not a brave one, and he had been frightened away as soon as he was wounded.\\n\\n\"I have been hurt,\" he said, \"so that I can not fight any more. But I could watch the gate for you, if you would like to go back in my place.\"\\n\\nAt first Sir Roland\\'s heart leaped with joy at this, but then he remembered what the commander had told him on going away, and he said:\\n\\n\"I should like to go, but a knight belongs where his commander has put him. My place is here at the gate, and I can not open it even for you. Your place is at the battle.\"\\n\\nThe knight was ashamed when he heard this, and he presently turned about and went into the forest again.\\n\\nSo Sir Roland kept guard silently for another hour. Then there came an old beggar woman down the path to the castle and asked Sir Roland if she might come in and have some food. He told her that no one could enter the castle that day, but that he would send a servant out to her with food, and that she might sit and rest as long as she would.\\n\\n\"I have been past the hollow in the forest where the battle is going on,\" said the old woman, while she was waiting for her food.\\n\\n\"And how do you think it is going?\" asked Sir Roland.\\n\\n\"Badly for the knights, I am afraid,\" said the old woman. \"The giants are fighting as they have never fought before. I should think you had better go and help your friends.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to, indeed,\" said Sir Roland. \"But I am set to guard the gateway of the castle and can not leave.\"\\n\\n\"One fresh knight would make a great difference when they are all weary with fighting,\" said the old woman. \"I should think that, while there are no enemies about, you would be much more useful there.\"\\n\\n\"You may well think so,\" said Sir Roland, \"and so may I; but it is neither you nor I that is commander here.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" said the old woman then, \"that you are one of the kind of 226 knights who like to keep out of fighting. You are lucky to have so good an excuse for staying at home.\" And she laughed a thin and taunting laugh.\\n\\nThen Sir Roland was very angry, and thought that if it were only a man instead of a woman, he would show him whether he liked fighting or no. But as it was a woman, he shut his lips and set his teeth hard together, and as the servant came just then with the food he had sent for, he gave it to the old woman quickly and shut the gate that she might not talk to him any more.\\n\\nIt was not very long before he heard some one calling outside. Sir Roland opened the gate and saw standing at the other end of the drawbridge a little old man in a long black cloak. \"Why are you knocking here?\" he said. \"The castle is closed to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Are you Sir Roland?\" said the little old man.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir Roland.\\n\\n\"Then you ought not to be staying here when your commander and his knights are having so hard a struggle with the giants, and when you have the chance to make of yourself the greatest knight in this kingdom. Listen to me! I have brought you a magic sword.\"\\n\\nAs he said this, the old man drew from under his coat a wonderful sword that flashed in the sunlight as if it were covered with diamonds. \"This is the sword of all swords,\" he said, \"and it is for you, if you will leave your idling here by the castle gate and carry it to the battle. Nothing can stand before it. When you lift it the giants will fall back, your master will be saved, and you will be crowned the victorious knight—the one who will soon take his commander\\'s place as lord of the castle.\"\\n\\nNow Sir Roland believed that it was a magician who was speaking to him, for it certainly appeared to be a magic sword. It seemed so wonderful that the sword should be brought to him, that he reached out his hand as though he would take it, and the little old man came forward, as though he would cross the drawbridge into the castle. But as he did so, it came to Sir Roland\\'s mind again that that bridge and the gateway had been intrusted to him, and he called out \"No!\" to the old man, so that he stopped where he was standing. But he waved the shining sword in the air again, and said: \"It is for you! Take it, and win the victory!\"\\n\\nSir Roland was really afraid that if he looked any longer at the sword or listened to any more words of the old man, he would not be able to hold himself within the castle. For this reason he struck the great bell at the gateway, which was the signal for the servants inside to pull in the chains of the drawbridge, and instantly they began to pull, and the drawbridge came up, so that the old man could not cross it to enter the castle, nor Sir Roland to go out.\\n\\nThen, as he looked across the moat, Sir Roland saw a wonderful thing. The little old man threw off his black cloak, and as he did so he began to grow bigger and bigger, until in a minute more he was a giant as tall as any in the forest. At first Sir Roland could scarcely believe his eyes. Then he realized that this must be one of their giant enemies, who had changed himself to a little old man through some magic power, that he might make his way into the castle while all the knights were away. Sir Roland shuddered to think what might have happened if he had taken the sword and left the gate unguarded. The giant shook his 227 fist across the moat that lay between them, and then, knowing that he could do nothing more, he went angrily back into the forest.\\n\\nSir Roland now resolved not to open the gate again, and to pay no attention to any other visitor. But it was not long before he heard a sound that made him spring forward in joy. It was the bugle of the lord of the castle, and there came sounding after it the bugles of many of the knights that were with him, pealing so joyfully that Sir Roland was sure they were safe and happy. As they came nearer, he could hear their shouts of victory. So he gave the signal to let down the drawbridge again, and went out to meet them. They were dusty and bloodstained and weary, but they had won the battle with the giants; and it had been such a great victory that there had never been a happier home-coming.\\n\\nSir Roland greeted them all as they passed in over the bridge, and then, when he had closed the gate and fastened it, he followed them into the great hall of the castle. The lord of the castle took his place on the highest seat, with the other knights about him, and Sir Roland came forward with the key of the gate, to give his account of what he had done in the place to which the commander had appointed him. The lord of the castle bowed to him as a sign for him to begin, but just as he opened his mouth to speak, one of the knights cried out:\\n\\n\"The shield! the shield! Sir Roland\\'s shield!\"\\n\\nEvery one turned and looked at the shield which Sir Roland carried on his left arm. He himself could see only the top of it and did not know what they could mean. But what they saw was the golden star of knighthood, shining brightly from the center of Sir Roland\\'s shield. There had never been such amazement in the castle before.\\n\\nSir Roland knelt before the lord of the castle to receive his commands. He still did not know why every one was looking at him so excitedly, and wondered if he had in some way done wrong.\\n\\n\"Speak, Sir Knight,\" said the commander, as soon as he could find his voice after his surprise, \"and tell us all that has happened to-day at the castle. Have you been attacked? Have any giants come hither? Did you fight them alone?\"\\n\\n\"No, my Lord,\" said Sir Roland. \"Only one giant has been here, and he went away silently when he found he could not enter.\"\\n\\nThen he told all that had happened through the day.\\n\\nWhen he had finished, the knights all looked at one another, but no one spoke a word. Then they looked again at Sir Roland\\'s shield, to make sure that their eyes had not deceived them, and there the golden star was still shining.\\n\\nAfter a little silence the lord of the castle spoke.\\n\\n\"Men make mistakes,\" he said, \"but our silver shields are never mistaken. Sir Roland has fought and won the hardest battle of all to-day.\"\\n\\nThen the others all rose and saluted Sir Roland, who was the youngest knight that ever carried the golden star.\\n\\n202\\n\\nJean Ingelow (1820-1897) was an English poet, novelist, and writer of stories for children, who lived in the fen district of Lincolnshire. Her most noted poem deals with a terrible catastrophe that happened there more than three centuries ago. It is called \"The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire.\" Many reading books for the third or fourth grade contain her dainty and melodious \"Seven Times One,\" in which a little girl expresses the joy and sense of power felt on reaching a seventh birthday. Of her children\\'s books, the favorite is Mopsa the Fairy, which some one has called a \"delightful succession of breezy impossibilities.\" Her shorter stories for children are collected under the title Stories Told to a Child (two series), from which \"The Prince\\'s Dream\" is taken. It is somewhat old fashioned in method and style, reminding one of the stories of the days of Addison and Steele. Its seriousness is in striking contrast with the more flippant note in much modern writing for children, and it is sure to suggest some questions on the dangers and advantages of great possessions in their effects on labor, liberty, and human happiness in general. However, the moral will take care of itself, and the attention should rest on the means used by the old man to teach the young prince the things he is shut out from learning by experience. The children will easily see that it is an anticipation of the moving-picture method. Some other good stories in the collection mentioned are \"I Have a Right,\" \"The Fairy Who Judged Her Neighbors,\" and \"Anselmo.\"\\n\\nTHE PRINCE\\'S DREAM\\n\\nJEAN INGELOW\\n\\nIf we may credit the fable, there is a tower in the midst of a great Asiatic plain, wherein is confined a prince who was placed there in his earliest infancy, with many slaves and attendants, and all the luxuries that are compatible with imprisonment.\\n\\nWhether he was brought there from some motive of state, whether to conceal him from enemies, or to deprive him of rights, has not transpired; but it is certain that up to the date of this little history he had never set his foot outside the walls of that high tower, and that of the vast world without he knew only the green plains which surrounded it; the flocks and the birds of that region were all his experience of living creatures, and all the men he saw outside were shepherds.\\n\\nAnd yet he was not utterly deprived of change, for sometimes one of his attendants would be ordered away, and his place would be supplied by a new one. This fresh companion the prince would never weary of questioning, and letting him talk of cities, of ships, of forests, of merchandise, of kings; but though in turns they all tried to satisfy his curiosity, they could not succeed in conveying very distinct notions to his mind; partly because there was nothing in the tower to which they could compare the external world, partly because, having chiefly lived lives of seclusion and indolence in Eastern palaces, they knew it only by hearsay themselves.\\n\\nAt length, one day, a venerable man of a noble presence was brought to the tower, with soldiers to guard him and slaves to attend him. The prince was glad of his presence, though at first he seldom opened his lips, and it was manifest that confinement made him miserable. With restless feet he would wander from window to window of the stone tower, and mount from story to story; but mount as high as he would there was still nothing to be seen but the vast unvarying plain, clothed with scanty grass, and flooded with the glaring sunshine; flocks and herds, and shepherds, moved across it sometimes, but nothing else, not even a shadow, for there was no cloud in the sky to cast one.\\n\\nThe old man, however, always treated the prince with respect, and answered his questions with a great deal of patience, till at length he found a pleasure in satisfying his curiosity, which so much pleased the young prisoner, that, as a great condescension, he invited him to come out on the roof of the tower and drink sherbet with him in the cool of the evening, and tell him of the country beyond the desert, and what seas are like, and mountains, and towns.\\n\\n\"I have learnt much from my attendants, and know this world pretty well by hearsay,\" said the prince, as they reclined on the rich carpet which was spread on the roof.\\n\\nThe old man smiled, but did not answer; perhaps because he did not care to undeceive his young companion, perhaps because so many slaves were present, some of whom were serving them with fruit, and others burning rich odors on a little chafing-dish that stood between them.\\n\\n\"But there are some words to which I never could attach any particular meaning,\" proceeded the prince, as the slaves began to retire, \"and three in particular that my attendants cannot satisfy me upon, or are reluctant to do so.\"\\n\\n\"What words are those, my prince?\" asked the old man. The prince turned on his elbow to be sure that the last slave had descended the tower stairs, then replied—\\n\\n\"O man of much knowledge, the words are these—Labor, and Liberty, and Gold.\"\\n\\n\"Prince,\" said the old man, \"I do not wonder that it has been hard to make thee understand the first, the nature of it, and the cause why most men are born to it; as for the second, it would be treason for thee and me to do more than whisper it here, and sigh for it when none are listening; but the third need hardly puzzle thee, thy hookah is bright with it; all thy jewels are set in it; gold is inlaid in the ivory of thy bath; thy cup and thy dish are of gold, and golden threads are wrought into thy raiment.\"\\n\\n\"That is true,\" replied the prince, \"and if I had not seen and handled this gold, perhaps I might not find its merits so hard to understand; but I possess it in abundance, and it does not feed me, nor make music for me, nor fan me when the sun is hot, nor cause me to sleep when I am weary; therefore when my slaves have told me how merchants go out and brave the perilous wind and sea, and live in the unstable ships, and run risks from shipwreck and pirates, and when, having asked them why they have done this, they have answered, \\'For gold,\\' I have found it hard to believe them; and when they have told me how men have lied, and robbed, and deceived; how they have murdered one another, and leagued together to depose kings, to oppress provinces, and all for gold; then I have said to myself, either my slaves have combined to make me believe that which is not, or this gold must be very different from the yellow stuff that this coin is made of, this coin which is of no use but to have a hole pierced through it and hang to my girdle, that it may tinkle when I walk.\"\\n\\n\"Notwithstanding,\" said the old man, \"nothing can be done without gold; for look you, prince, it is better than bread, and fruit, and music, for it can buy them all, since men love it, and have agreed to exchange it for whatever they may need.\"\\n\\n\"How so?\" asked the prince.\\n\\n\"If a man has many loaves he cannot eat them all,\" answered the old man; \"therefore he goes to his neighbor and 230 says, \\'I have bread and thou hast a coin of gold—let us change\\'; so he receives the gold and goes to another man, saying, \\'Thou hast two houses and I have none; lend me one of thy houses to live in, and I will give thee my gold\\'; thus again they change, and he that has the gold says, \\'I have food enough and goods enough, but I want a wife, I will go to the merchant and get a marriage gift for her father, and for it I will give him this gold.\\'\"\\n\\n\"It is well,\" said the prince; \"but in time of drought, if there is no bread in a city, can they make it of gold?\"\\n\\n\"Not so,\" answered the old man, \"but they must send their gold to a city where there is food, and bring that back instead of it.\"\\n\\n\"But if there was a famine all over the world,\" asked the prince, \"what would they do then?\"\\n\\n\"Why then, and only then,\" said the old man, \"they must starve, and the gold would be nought, for it can only be changed for that which is; it cannot make that which is not.\"\\n\\n\"And where do they get gold?\" asked the prince; \"is it the precious fruit of some rare tree, or have they whereby they can draw it down from the sky at sunset?\"\\n\\n\"Some of it,\" said the old man, \"they dig out of the ground.\"\\n\\nThen he told the prince of ancient rivers running through terrible deserts, whose sands glitter, with golden grains and are yellow in the fierce heat of the sun, and of dreary mines where the Indian slaves work in gangs tied together, never seeing the light of day; and lastly (for he was a man of much knowledge, and had traveled far), he told him of the valley of the Sacramento in the New World, and of those mountains where the people of Europe send their criminals, and where now their free men pour forth to gather gold, and dig for it as hard as if for life; sitting up by it at night lest any should take it from them, giving up houses and country, and wife and children, for the sake of a few feet of mud, whence they dig clay that glitters as they wash it; and how they sift it and rock it as patiently as if it were their own children in the cradle, and afterwards carry it in their bosoms, and forego on account of it safety and rest.\\n\\n\"But, prince,\" he proceeded, observing that the young man was absorbed in his narrative, \"if you would pass your word to me never to betray me, I would procure for you a sight of the external world, and in a trance you should see those places where gold is dug, and traverse those regions forbidden to your mortal footsteps.\"\\n\\nUpon this, the prince threw himself at the old man\\'s feet, and promised heartily to observe the secrecy required, and entreated that, for however short time, he might be suffered to see this wonderful world.\\n\\nThen, if we may credit the story, the old man drew nearer to the chafing-dish which stood between them, and having fanned the dying embers in it, cast upon them a certain powder and some herbs, from whence as they burnt a peculiar smoke arose. As their vapors spread, he desired the prince to draw near and inhale them, and then (says the fable) when he should sleep he should find himself, in his dream, at whatever place he might desire, with this strange advantage, that he should see things in their truth and reality as well as in their outward shows.\\n\\nSo the prince, not without some fear, prepared to obey; but first he drank his 231 sherbet, and handed over the golden cup to the old man by way of recompense; then he reclined beside the chafing-dish and inhaled the heavy perfume till he became overpowered with sleep, and sank down upon the carpet in a dream.\\n\\nThe prince knew not where he was, but a green country was floating before him, and he found himself standing in a marshy valley, where a few wretched cottages were scattered here and there with no means of communication. There was a river, but it had overflowed its banks and made the central land impassable, the fences had been broken down by it, and the fields of corn laid low; a few wretched peasants were wandering about there; they looked half clad and half starved. \"A miserable valley indeed!\" exclaimed the prince; but as he said it a man came down from the hills with a great bag of gold in his hand.\\n\\n\"This valley is mine,\" said he to the people; \"I have bought it for gold. Now make banks that the river may not overflow, and I will give you gold; also make fences and plant fields, and cover in the roofs of your houses, and buy yourselves richer clothing.\" So the people did so, and as the gold got lower in the bag the valley grew fairer and greener, till the prince exclaimed, \"O gold, I see your value now! O wonderful, beneficent gold!\"\\n\\nBut presently the valley melted away like a mist, and the prince saw an army besieging a city; he heard a general haranguing his soldiers to urge them on, and the soldiers shouting and battering the walls; but shortly, when the city was well-nigh taken, he saw some men secretly throwing gold among the soldiers, so much of it that they threw down their arms to pick it up, and said that the walls were so strong that they could not throw them down. \"O powerful gold!\" thought the prince; \"thou art stronger than the city walls!\"\\n\\nAfter that it seemed to himself that he was walking about in a desert country, and in his dream he thought, \"Now I know what labor is, for I have seen it, and its benefits; and I know what liberty is, for I have tasted it; I can wander where I will, and no man questions me; but gold is more strange to me than ever, for I have seen it buy both liberty and labor.\" Shortly after this he saw a great crowd digging upon a barren hill, and when he drew near he understood that he had reached the summit of his wishes, and that he was to see the place where the gold came from.\\n\\nHe came up and stood a long time watching the people as they toiled ready to faint in the sun, so great was the labor of digging the gold.\\n\\nHe saw who had much and could not trust any one to help them to carry it, binding it in bundles over their shoulders, and bending and groaning under its weight; he saw others hide it in the ground, and watch the place clothed in rags, that none might suspect that they were rich; but some, on the contrary, who had dug up an unusual quantity, he saw dancing and singing, and vaunting their success, till robbers waylaid them when they slept, and rifled their bundles and carried their golden sand away.\\n\\n\"All these men are mad,\" thought the prince, \"and this pernicious gold has made them so.\"\\n\\nAfter this, as he wandered here and there, he saw groups of people smelting the gold under the shadow of the trees, and he observed that a dancing, quivering vapor rose up from it, which dazzled their 232 eyes, and distorted everything that they looked at; arraying it also in different colors from the true one. He observed that this vapor from the gold caused all things to rock and reel before the eyes of those who looked through it, and also, by some strange affinity, it drew their hearts towards those that carried much gold on their persons, so that they called them good and beautiful; it also caused them to see darkness and dullness in the faces of those who carried none. \"This,\" thought the prince, \"is very strange\"; but not being able to explain it, he went still further, and there he saw more people. Each of these had adorned himself with a broad golden girdle, and was sitting in the shade, while other men waited on them.\\n\\n\"What ails these people?\" he inquired of one who was looking on, for he observed a peculiar air of weariness and dullness in their faces. He was answered that the girdles were very tight and heavy, and being bound over the regions of the heart, were supposed to impede its action, and prevent it from beating high, and also to chill the wearer, as being of opaque material, the warm sunshine of the earth could not get through to warm him.\\n\\n\"Why, then, do they not break them asunder,\" exclaimed the prince, \"and fling them away?\"\\n\\n\"Break them asunder!\" cried the man; \"why what a madman you must be; they are made of the purest gold!\"\\n\\n\"Forgive my ignorance,\" replied the prince; \"I am a stranger.\"\\n\\nSo he walked on, for feelings of delicacy prevented him from gazing any longer at the men with the golden girdles; but as he went he pondered on the misery he had seen, and thought to himself that this golden sand did more mischief than all the poisons of the apothecary; for it dazzled the eyes of some, it strained the hearts of others, it bowed down the heads of many to the earth with its weight; it was a sore labor to gather it, and when it was gathered, the robber might carry it away; it would be a good thing, he thought, if there were none of it.\\n\\nAfter this he came to a place where were sitting some aged widows and some orphan children of the gold-diggers, who were helpless and destitute; they were weeping and bemoaning themselves, but stopped at the approach of a man, whose appearance attracted the prince, for he had a very great bundle of gold on his back, and yet it did not bow him down at all; his apparel was rich but he had no girdle on, and his face was anything but sad.\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said the prince to him, \"you have a great burden; you are fortunate to be able to stand under it.\"\\n\\n\"I could not do so,\" he replied, \"only that as I go on I keep lightening it\"; and as he passed each of the widows, he threw gold to her, and stooping down, hid pieces of it in the bosoms of the children.\\n\\n\"You have no girdle,\" said the prince.\\n\\n\"I once had one,\" answered the gold gatherer; \"but it was so tight over my breast that my very heart grew cold under it, and almost ceased to beat. Having a great quantity of gold on my back, I felt almost at the last gasp; so I threw off my girdle and being on the bank of a river, which I knew not how to cross, I was about to fling it in, I was so vexed! \\'But no,\\' thought I, \\'there are many people waiting here to cross besides myself. I will make my girdle into a bridge, and we will cross over on it.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Turn your girdle into a bridge!\" exclaimed the prince doubtfully, for he did not quite understand.\\n\\nThe man explained himself. 233\\n\\n\"And then, sir, after that,\" he continued, \"I turned one half of my burden into bread, and gave it to these poor people. Since then I have not been oppressed by its weight, however heavy it may have been; for few men have a heavier one. In fact, I gather more from day to day.\"\\n\\nAs the man kept speaking, he scattered his gold right and left with a cheerful countenance, and the prince was about to reply, when suddenly a great trembling under his feet made him fall to the ground. The refining fires of the gold gatherers sprang up into flames, and then went out; night fell over everything on the earth, and nothing was visible in the sky but the stars of the southern cross, which were glittering above him.\\n\\n\"It is past midnight,\" thought the prince, \"for the stars of the cross begin to bend.\"\\n\\nHe raised himself upon his elbow, and tried to pierce the darkness, but could not. At length a slender blue flame darted out, as from ashes in a chafing-dish, and by the light of it he saw the strange pattern of his carpet and the cushions lying about. He did not recognise them at first, but presently he knew that he was lying in his usual place, at the top of his tower.\\n\\n\"Wake up, prince,\" said the old man.\\n\\nThe prince sat up and sighed, and the old man inquired what he had seen.\\n\\n\"O man of much learning!\" answered the prince, \"I have seen that this is a wonderful world; I have seen the value of labor, and I know the uses of it; I have tasted the sweetness of liberty, and am grateful, though it was but in a dream; but as for that other word that was so great a mystery to me, I only know this, that it must remain a mystery forever, since I am fain to believe that all men are bent on getting it; though, once gotten, it causeth them endless disquietude, only second to their discomfort that are without it. I am fain to believe that they can procure with it whatever they most desire, and yet that it cankers their hearts and dazzles their eyes; that it is their nature and their duty to gather it; and yet that, when once gathered, the best thing they can do is to scatter it!\"\\n\\nAlas! the prince visited this wonderful world no more; for the next morning, when he awoke, the old man was gone. He had taken with him the golden cup which the prince had given him. And the sentinel was also gone, none knew whither. Perhaps the old man had turned his golden cup into a golden key.\\n\\n203\\n\\nFew modern writers have given their readers more genuine delight than Frank R. Stockton (1834-1902). The most absurd and illogical situations and characters are presented with an air of such quiet sincerity that one refuses to question the reality of it all. Rudder Grange established his reputation in 1879, and was followed by a long list of stories of delightfully impossible events. For several years Stockton was one of the editors of St. Nicholas, and some of his stories for children, of first quality in both form and content, deserve to be better known than they are. Five of the best of them for school use have been brought together in a little volume called Fanciful Tales. One of these, \"Old Pipes and the Dryad,\" is given here by permission of the publishers, Charles Scribner\\'s Sons, New York. (Copyright, 1894.) This story is based upon the old mythical belief that the trees are inhabited by guardian deities known as dryads, or hamadryads. To injure a tree meant to injure its guardian spirit and was almost certain to insure 234 disaster for the guilty person. On the other hand, to protect a tree would bring some token of appreciation from the dryad. A good introduction to the story would be the telling of one or two of these tree myths as found in Gayley\\'s Classic Myths or Bulfinch\\'s Age of Fable. A fine literary version of one of them is in Lowell\\'s \"Rhoecus.\" But the beautiful and kindly helpfulness of Old Pipes will carry its own message whether one knows any mythology or not.\\n\\nOLD PIPES AND THE DRYAD\\n\\nFRANK R. STOCKTON\\n\\nA Mountain brook ran through a little village. Over the brook there was a narrow bridge, and from the bridge a foot-path led out from the village and up the hill-side, to the cottage of Old Pipes and his mother.\\n\\nFor many, many years Old Pipes had been employed by the villagers to pipe the cattle down from the hills. Every afternoon, an hour before sunset, he would sit on a rock in front of his cottage and play on his pipes. Then all the flocks and herds that were grazing on the mountains would hear him, wherever they might happen to be, and would come down to the village—the cows by the easiest paths, the sheep by those not quite so easy, and the goats by the steep and rocky ways that were hardest of all.\\n\\nBut now, for a year or more, Old Pipes had not piped the cattle home. It is true that every afternoon he sat upon the rock and played upon his pipes; but the cattle did not hear him. He had grown old, and his breath was feeble. The echoes of his cheerful notes, which used to come from the rocky hill on the other side of the valley, were heard no more; and twenty yards from Old Pipes one could scarcely tell what tune he was playing. He had become somewhat deaf, and did not know that the sound of his pipes was so thin and weak, and that the cattle did not hear him. The cows, the sheep, and the goats came down every afternoon as before; but this was because two boys and a girl were sent up after them. The villagers did not wish the good old man to know that his piping was no longer of any use; so they paid him his little salary every month, and said nothing about the two boys and the girl.\\n\\nOld Pipes\\'s mother was, of course, a great deal older than he was, and was as deaf as a gate—post, latch, hinges, and all—and she never knew that the sound of her son\\'s pipe did not spread over all the mountain-side and echo back strong and clear from the opposite hills. She was very fond of Old Pipes, and proud of his piping; and as he was so much younger than she was, she never thought of him as being very old. She cooked for him, and made his bed, and mended his clothes; and they lived very comfortably on his little salary.\\n\\nOne afternoon, at the end of the month, when Old Pipes had finished his piping, he took his stout staff and went down the hill to the village to receive the money for his month\\'s work. The path seemed a great deal steeper and more difficult than it used to be; and Old Pipes thought that it must have been washed by the rains and greatly damaged. He remembered it as a path that was quite easy to traverse either up or down. But Old Pipes had been a very active man, and as his mother was so much older than he was, he never thought of himself as aged and infirm. 235\\n\\nWhen the Chief Villager had paid him, and he had talked a little with some of his friends, Old Pipes started to go home. But when he had crossed the bridge over the brook, and gone a short distance up the hill-side, he became very tired, and sat down upon a stone. He had not been sitting there half a minute, when along came two boys and a girl.\\n\\n\"Children,\" said Old Pipes, \"I\\'m very tired to-night, and I don\\'t believe I can climb up this steep path to my home. I think I shall have to ask you to help me.\"\\n\\n\"We will do that,\" said the boys and the girl, quite cheerfully; and one boy took him by the right hand and the other by the left, while the girl pushed him in the back. In this way he went up the hill quite easily, and soon reached his cottage door. Old Pipes gave each of the three children a copper coin, and then they sat down for a few minutes\\' rest before starting back to the village.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry that I tired you so much,\" said Old Pipes.\\n\\n\"Oh, that would not have tired us,\" said one of the boys, \"if we had not been so far to-day after the cows, the sheep, and the goats. They rambled high up on the mountain, and we never before had such a time in finding them.\"\\n\\n\"Had to go after the cows, the sheep, and the goats!\" exclaimed Old Pipes. \"What do you mean by that?\"\\n\\nThe girl, who stood behind the old man, shook her head, put her hand on her mouth, and made all sorts of signs to the boy to stop talking on this subject; but he did not notice her, and promptly answered Old Pipes.\\n\\n\"Why, you see, good sir,\" said he, \"that as the cattle can\\'t hear your pipes now, somebody has to go after them every evening to drive them down from the mountain, and the Chief Villager has hired us three to do it. Generally it is not very hard work, but to-night the cattle had wandered far.\"\\n\\n\"How long have you been doing this?\" asked the old man.\\n\\nThe girl shook her head and clapped her hand on her mouth as before, but the boy went on.\\n\\n\"I think it is about a year now,\" he said, \"since the people first felt sure that the cattle could not hear your pipes; and from that time we\\'ve been driving them down. But we are rested now, and will go home. Good-night, sir.\"\\n\\nThe three children then went down the hill, the girl scolding the boy all the way home. Old Pipes stood silent a few moments, and then he went into his cottage.\\n\\n\"Mother,\" he shouted, \"did you hear what those children said?\"\\n\\n\"Children!\" exclaimed the old woman; \"I did not hear them. I did not know there were any children here.\"\\n\\nThen Old Pipes told his mother—shouting very loudly to make her hear—how the two boys and the girl had helped him up the hill, and what he had heard about his piping and the cattle.\\n\\n\"They can\\'t hear you?\" cried his mother. \"Why, what\\'s the matter with the cattle?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, me!\" said Old Pipes; \"I don\\'t believe there\\'s anything the matter with the cattle. It must be with me and my pipes that there is something the matter. But one thing is certain: if I do not earn the wages the Chief Villager pays me, I shall not take them. I shall go straight down to the village and give back the money I received to-day.\" 236\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" cried his mother. \"I\\'m sure you\\'ve piped as well as you could, and no more can be expected. And what are we to do without the money?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Old Pipes; \"but I\\'m going down to the village to pay it back.\"\\n\\nThe sun had now set; but the moon was shining very brightly on the hill-side, and Old Pipes could see his way very well. He did not take the same path by which he had gone before, but followed another, which led among the trees upon the hill-side, and, though longer, was not so steep.\\n\\nWhen he had gone about half-way, the old man sat down to rest, leaning his back against a great oak tree. As he did so, he heard a sound like knocking inside the tree, and then a voice said:\\n\\n\"Let me out! let me out!\"\\n\\nOld Pipes instantly forgot that he was tired, and sprang to his feet. \"This must be a Dryad tree!\" he exclaimed. \"If it is, I\\'ll let her out.\"\\n\\nOld Pipes had never, to his knowledge, seen a Dryad tree, but he knew there were such trees on the hill-sides and the mountains, and that Dryads lived in them. He knew, too, that in the summer time, on those days when the moon rose before the sun went down, a Dryad could come out of her tree if any one could find the key which locked her in, and turn it. Old Pipes closely examined the trunk of the tree, which stood in the full moonlight. \"If I see that key,\" he said, \"I shall surely turn it.\" Before long he found a piece of bark standing out from the tree, which looked to him very much like the handle of a key. He took hold of it, and found he could turn it quite around. As he did so, a large part of the side of the tree was pushed open, and a beautiful Dryad stepped quickly out.\\n\\nTranscriber\\'s Note: original reads \\'Dyrad\\'\\n\\nFor a moment she stood motionless, gazing on the scene before her—the tranquil valley, the hills, the forest, and the mountain-side, all lying in the soft clear light of the moon. \"Oh, lovely! lovely!\" she exclaimed. \"How long it is since I have seen anything like this!\" And then, turning to Old Pipes, she said: \"How good of you to let me out! I am so happy, and so thankful, that I must kiss you, you dear old man!\" And she threw her arms around the neck of Old Pipes, and kissed him on both cheeks.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know,\" she then went on to say, \"how doleful it is to be shut up so long in a tree. I don\\'t mind it in the winter, for then I am glad to be sheltered, but in summer it is a rueful thing not to be able to see all the beauties of the world. And it\\'s ever so long since I\\'ve been let out. People so seldom come this way; and when they do come at the right time, they either don\\'t hear me or they are frightened and run away. But you, you dear old man, you were not frightened, and you looked and looked for the key, and you let me out; and now I shall not have to go back till winter has come, and the air grows cold. Oh, it is glorious! What can I do for you, to show you how grateful I am?\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad,\" said Old Pipes, \"that I let you out, since I see that it makes you so happy; but I must admit that I tried to find the key because I had a great desire to see a Dryad. But, if you wish to do something for me, you can, if you happen to be going down toward the village.\"\\n\\n\"To the village!\" exclaimed the Dryad. 237 \"I will go anywhere for you, my kind old benefactor.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" said Old Pipes, \"I wish you would take this little bag of money to the Chief Villager and tell him that Old Pipes cannot receive pay for the services which he does not perform. It is now more than a year that I have not been able to make the cattle hear me, when I piped to call them home. I did not know this until to-night; but now that I know it, I cannot keep the money, and so I send it back.\" And, handing the little bag to the Dryad, he bade her good-night, and turned toward his cottage.\\n\\n\"Good-night,\" said the Dryad. \"And I thank you over, and over, and over again, you good old man!\"\\n\\nOld Pipes walked toward his home, very glad to be saved the fatigue of going all the way down to the village and back again. \"To be sure,\" he said to himself, \"this path does not seem at all steep, and I can walk along it very easily; but it would have tired me dreadfully to come up all the way from the village, especially as I could not have expected those children to help me again.\" When he reached home his mother was surprised to see him returning so soon.\\n\\n\"What!\" she exclaimed; \"have you already come back? What did the Chief Villager say? Did he take the money?\"\\n\\nOld Pipes was just about to tell her that he had sent the money to the village by a Dryad, when he suddenly reflected that his mother would be sure to disapprove such a proceeding, and so he merely said he had sent it by a person whom he had met.\\n\\n\"And how do you know that the person will ever take it to the Chief Villager?\" cried his mother. \"You will lose it, and the villagers will never get it. Oh, Pipes! Pipes! when will you be old enough to have ordinary common-sense?\"\\n\\nOld Pipes considered that, as he was already seventy years of age, he could scarcely expect to grow any wiser; but he made no remark on this subject, and, saying that he doubted not that the money would go safely to its destination, he sat down to his supper. His mother scolded him roundly, but he did not mind it; and after supper he went out and sat on a rustic chair in front of the cottage to look at the moonlit village, and to wonder whether or not the Chief Villager really received the money. While he was doing these two things, he went fast asleep.\\n\\nWhen Old Pipes left the Dryad, she did not go down to the village with the little bag of money. She held it in her hand, and thought about what she had heard. \"This is a good and honest old man,\" she said; \"and it is a shame that he should lose this money. He looked as if he needed it, and I don\\'t believe the people in the village will take it from one who has served them so long. Often, when in my tree, have I heard the sweet notes of his pipes. I am going to take the money back to him.\" She did not start immediately, because there were so many beautiful things to look at; but after awhile she went up to the cottage, and, finding Old Pipes asleep in his chair, she slipped the little bag into his coat-pocket, and silently sped away.\\n\\nThe next day Old Pipes told his mother that he would go up the mountain and cut some wood. He had a right to get wood from the mountain, but for a long time he had been content to pick up the dead branches which lay about his cottage. To-day, however, he felt so strong and vigorous that he thought he would 238 go and cut some fuel that would be better than this. He worked all the morning, and when he came back he did not feel at all tired, and he had a very good appetite for his dinner.\\n\\nNow, Old Pipes knew a good deal about Dryads; but there was one thing which, although he had heard, he had forgotten. This was, that a kiss from a Dryad made a person ten years younger.\\n\\nThe people of the village knew this, and they were very careful not to let any child of ten years or younger go into the woods where the Dryads were supposed to be; for, if they should chance to be kissed by one of these tree-nymphs, they would be set back so far that they would cease to exist.\\n\\nA story was told in the village that a very bad boy of eleven once ran away into the woods, and had an adventure of this kind; and when his mother found him he was a little baby of one year old. Taking advantage of her opportunity, she brought him up more carefully than she had done before, and he grew to be a very good boy indeed.\\n\\nNow Old Pipes had been kissed twice by the Dryad, once on each cheek, and he therefore felt as vigorous and active as when he was a hale man of fifty. His mother noticed how much work he was doing, and told him that he need not try in that way to make up for the loss of his piping wages; for he would only tire himself out, and get sick. But her son answered that he had not felt so well for years, and that he was quite able to work.\\n\\nIn the course of the afternoon, Old Pipes, for the first time that day, put his hand in his coat-pocket, and there, to his amazement, he found the little bag of money. \"Well, well!\" he exclaimed, \"I am stupid, indeed! I really thought that I had seen a Dryad; but when I sat down by that big oak tree I must have gone to sleep and dreamed it all; and then I came home, thinking I had given the money to a Dryad, when it was in my pocket all the time. But the Chief Villager shall have the money. I shall not take it to him to-day, but to-morrow I wish to go to the village to see some of my old friends; and then I shall give up the money.\"\\n\\nToward the close of the afternoon, Old Pipes, as had been his custom for so many years, took his pipes from the shelf on which they lay, and went out to the rock in front of the cottage.\\n\\n\"What are you going to do?\" cried his mother. \"If you will not consent to be paid, why do you pipe?\"\\n\\n\"I am going to pipe for my own pleasure,\" said her son. \"I am used to it, and I do not wish to give it up. It does not matter now whether the cattle hear me or not, and I am sure that my piping will injure no one.\"\\n\\nWhen the good man began to play upon his favorite instrument he was astonished at the sound that came from it. The beautiful notes of the pipes sounded clear and strong down into the valley, and spread over the hills, and up the sides of the mountain beyond, while, after a little interval, an echo came back from the rocky hill on the other side of the valley.\\n\\n\"Ha! ha!\" he cried, \"what has happened to my pipes? They must have been stopped up of late, but now they are as clear and good as ever.\"\\n\\nAgain the merry notes went sounding far and wide. The cattle on the mountain heard them, and those that were old enough remembered how these notes had called them from their pastures 239 every evening, and so they started down the mountain-side, the others following.\\n\\nThe merry notes were heard in the village below, and the people were much astonished thereby. \"Why, who can be blowing the pipes of Old Pipes?\" they said. But, as they were all very busy, no one went up to see. One thing, however, was plain enough: the cattle were coming down the mountain. And so the two boys and the girl did not have to go after them, and had an hour for play, for which they were very glad.\\n\\nThe next morning Old Pipes started down to the village with his money, and on the way he met the Dryad. \"Oh, ho!\" he cried, \"is that you? Why, I thought my letting you out of the tree was nothing but a dream.\"\\n\\n\"A dream!\" cried the Dryad; \"if you only knew how happy you have made me, you would not think it merely a dream. And has it not benefited you? Do you not feel happier? Yesterday I heard you playing beautifully on your pipes.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried he. \"I did not understand it before, but I see it all now. I have really grown younger. I thank you, I thank you, good Dryad, from the bottom of my heart. It was the finding of the money in my pocket that made me think it was a dream.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I put it in when you were asleep,\" she said, laughing, \"because I thought you ought to keep it. Good-by, kind, honest man. May you live long, and be as happy as I am now.\"\\n\\nOld Pipes was greatly delighted when he understood that he was really a younger man; but that made no difference about the money, and he kept on his way to the village. As soon as he reached it, he was eagerly questioned as to who had been playing his pipes the evening before, and when the people heard that it was himself they were very much surprised. Thereupon Old Pipes told what had happened to him, and then there was greater wonder, with hearty congratulations and hand-shakes; for Old Pipes was liked by everyone. The Chief Villager refused to take his money; and although Old Pipes said that he had not earned it, everyone present insisted that, as he would now play on his pipes as before, he should lose nothing because, for a time, he was unable to perform his duty.\\n\\nSo Old Pipes was obliged to keep his money, and after an hour or two spent in conversation with his friends he returned to his cottage.\\n\\nThere was one person, however, who was not pleased with what had happened to Old Pipes. This was an Echo-dwarf who lived on the hills across the valley. It was his work to echo back the notes of the pipes whenever they could be heard.\\n\\nA great many other Echo-dwarfs lived on these hills. They all worked, but in different ways. Some echoed back the songs of maidens, some the shouts of children, and others the music that was often heard in the village. But there was only one who could send back the strong notes of the pipes of Old Pipes, and this had been his sole duty for many years. But when the old man grew feeble, and the notes of his pipes could not be heard on the opposite hills, this Echo-dwarf had nothing to do, and he spent his time in delightful idleness; and he slept so much and grew so fat that it made his companions laugh to see him walk. 240\\n\\nOn the afternoon on which, after so long an interval, the sound of the pipes was heard on the echo hills, this dwarf was fast asleep behind a rock. As soon as the first notes reached them, some of his companions ran to wake him up. Rolling to his feet, he echoed back the merry tune of Old Pipes.\\n\\nNaturally, he was very angry at being thus obliged to give up his life of comfort, and he hoped very much that this pipe-playing would not occur again. The next afternoon he was awake and listening, and, sure enough, at the usual hour, along came the notes of the pipes as clear and strong as they ever had been; and he was obliged to work as long as Old Pipes played. The Echo-dwarf was very angry. He had supposed, of course, that the pipe-playing had ceased forever, and he felt that he had a right to be indignant at being thus deceived. He was so much disturbed that he made up his mind to go and try to find out how long this was to last. He had plenty of time, as the pipes were played but once a day, and he set off early in the morning for the hill on which Old Pipes lived. It was hard work for the fat little fellow, and when he had crossed the valley and had gone some distance into the woods on the hill-side, he stopped to rest, and in a few minutes the Dryad came tripping along.\\n\\n\"Ho, ho!\" exclaimed the dwarf; \"what are you doing here? and how did you get out of your tree?\"\\n\\n\"Doing!\" cried the Dryad; \"I am being happy; that\\'s what I am doing. And I was let out of my tree by the good old man who plays the pipes to call the cattle down from the mountain. And it makes me happier to think that I have been of service to him. I gave him two kisses of gratitude, and now he is young enough to play his pipes as well as ever.\"\\n\\nThe Echo-dwarf stepped forward, his face pale with passion. \"Am I to believe,\" he said, \"that you are the cause of this great evil that has come upon me? and that you are the wicked creature who has again started this old man upon his career of pipe-playing? What have I ever done to you that you should have condemned me for years and years to echo back the notes of those wretched pipes?\"\\n\\nAt this the Dryad laughed loudly.\\n\\n\"What a funny little fellow you are!\" she said. \"Anyone would think you had been condemned to toil from morning till night; while what you really have to do is merely to imitate for half an hour every day the merry notes of Old Pipes\\'s piping. Fie upon you, Echo-dwarf! You are lazy and selfish; and that is what is the matter with you. Instead of grumbling at being obliged to do a little wholesome work, which is less, I am sure, than that of any other echo-dwarf upon the rocky hill-side, you should rejoice at the good fortune of the old man who has regained so much of his strength and vigor. Go home and learn to be just and generous; and then, perhaps, you may be happy. Good-by.\"\\n\\n\"Insolent creature!\" shouted the dwarf, as he shook his fat little fist at her. \"I\\'ll make you suffer for this. You shall find out what it is to heap injury and insult upon one like me, and to snatch from him the repose that he has earned by long years of toil.\" And, shaking his head savagely, he hurried back to the rocky hill-side.\\n\\nEvery afternoon the merry notes of 241 the pipes of Old Pipes sounded down into the valley and over the hills and up the mountain-side; and every afternoon when he had echoed them back, the little dwarf grew more and more angry with the Dryad. Each day, from early morning till it was time for him to go back to his duties upon the rocky hill-side, he searched the woods for her. He intended, if he met her, to pretend to be very sorry for what he had said, and he thought he might be able to play a trick upon her which would avenge him well.\\n\\nOne day, while thus wandering among the trees, he met Old Pipes. The Echo-dwarf did not generally care to see or speak to ordinary people; but now he was so anxious to find the object of his search, that he stopped and asked Old Pipes if he had seen the Dryad. The piper had not noticed the little fellow, and he looked down on him with some surprise.\\n\\n\"No,\" he said; \"I have not seen her, and I have been looking everywhere for her.\"\\n\\n\"You!\" cried the dwarf, \"what do you wish with her?\"\\n\\nOld Pipes then sat down on a stone, so that he should be nearer the ear of his small companion, and he told what the Dryad had done for him.\\n\\nWhen the Echo-dwarf heard that this was the man whose pipes he was obliged to echo back every day, he would have slain him on the spot, had he been able; but, as he was not able, he merely ground his teeth and listened to the rest of the story.\\n\\n\"I am looking for the Dryad now,\" Old Pipes continued, \"on account of my aged mother. When I was old myself, I did not notice how very old my mother was; but now it shocks me to see how feeble her years have caused her to become; and I am looking for the Dryad to ask her to make my mother younger, as she made me.\"\\n\\nThe eyes of the Echo-dwarf glistened. Here was a man who might help him in his plans.\\n\\n\"Your idea is a good one,\" he said to Old Pipes, \"and it does you honor. But you should know that a Dryad can make no person younger but one who lets her out of her tree. However, you can manage the affair very easily. All you need do is to find the Dryad, tell her what you want, and request her to step into her tree and be shut up for a short time. Then you will go and bring your mother to the tree; she will open it, and everything will be as you wish. Is not this a good plan?\"\\n\\n\"Excellent!\" cried Old Pipes; \"and I will go instantly and search more diligently for the Dryad.\"\\n\\n\"Take me with you,\" said the Echo-dwarf. \"You can easily carry me on your strong shoulders; and I shall be glad to help you in any way that I can.\"\\n\\n\"Now then,\" said the little fellow to himself, as Old Pipes carried him rapidly along, \"if he persuades the Dryad to get into a tree,—and she is quite foolish enough to do it,—and then goes away to bring his mother, I shall take a stone or a club and I will break off the key of that tree, so that nobody can ever turn it again. Then Mistress Dryad will see what she has brought upon herself by her behavior to me.\"\\n\\nBefore long they came to the great oak tree in which the Dryad had lived, and at a distance they saw that beautiful creature herself coming toward them.\\n\\n\"How excellently well everything happens!\" said the dwarf. \"Put me down, 242 and I will go. Your business with the Dryad is more important than mine; and you need not say anything about my having suggested your plan to you. I am willing that you should have all the credit of it yourself.\"\\n\\nOld Pipes put the Echo-dwarf upon the ground, but the little rogue did not go away. He hid himself between some low, mossy rocks, and he was so much like them in color that you would not have noticed him if you had been looking straight at him.\\n\\nWhen the Dryad came up, Old Pipes lost no time in telling her about his mother, and what he wished her to do. At first, the Dryad answered nothing, but stood looking very sadly at Old Pipes.\\n\\n\"Do you really wish me to go into my tree again?\" she said. \"I should dreadfully dislike to do it, for I don\\'t know what might happen. It is not at all necessary, for I could make your mother younger at any time if she would give me the opportunity. I had already thought of making you still happier in this way, and several times I have waited about your cottage, hoping to meet your aged mother, but she never comes outside, and you know a Dryad cannot enter a house. I cannot imagine what put this idea into your head. Did you think of it yourself?\"\\n\\n\"No, I cannot say that I did,\" answered Old Pipes. \"A little dwarf whom I met in the woods proposed it to me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried the Dryad; \"now I see through it all. It is the scheme of that vile Echo-dwarf—your enemy and mine. Where is he? I should like to see him.\"\\n\\n\"I think he has gone away,\" said Old Pipes.\\n\\n\"No, he has not,\" said the Dryad, whose quick eyes perceived the Echo-dwarf among the rocks, \"there he is. Seize him and drag him out, I beg of you.\"\\n\\nOld Pipes saw the dwarf as soon as he was pointed out to him; and running to the rocks, he caught the little fellow by the arm and pulled him out.\\n\\n\"Now, then,\" cried the Dryad, who had opened the door of the great oak, \"just stick him in there, and we will shut him up. Then I shall be safe from his mischief for the rest of the time I am free.\"\\n\\nOld Pipes thrust the Echo-dwarf into the tree; the Dryad pushed the door shut; there was a clicking sound of bark and wood, and no one would have noticed that the big oak had ever had an opening in it.\\n\\n\"There,\" said the Dryad; \"now we need not be afraid of him. And I assure you, my good piper, that I shall be very glad to make your mother younger as soon as I can. Will you not ask her to come out and meet me?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I will,\" cried Old Pipes; \"and I will do it without delay.\"\\n\\nAnd then, the Dryad by his side, he hurried to his cottage. But when he mentioned the matter to his mother, the old woman became very angry indeed. She did not believe in Dryads; and, if they really did exist, she knew they must be witches and sorceresses, and she would have nothing to do with them. If her son had ever allowed himself to be kissed by one of them, he ought to be ashamed of himself. As to its doing him the least bit of good, she did not believe a word of it. He felt better than he used to feel, but that was very common. She had sometimes felt that way herself, and she forbade him ever to mention a Dryad to her again.\\n\\nThat afternoon, Old Pipes, feeling 243 very sad that his plan in regard to his mother had failed, sat down upon the rock and played upon his pipes. The pleasant sounds went down the valley and up the hills and mountain, but, to the great surprise of some persons who happened to notice the fact, the notes were not echoed back from the rocky hill-side, but from the woods on the side of the valley on which Old Pipes lived. The next day many of the villagers stopped in their work to listen to the echo of the pipes coming from the woods. The sound was not as clear and strong as it used to be when it was sent back from the rocky hill-side, but it certainly came from among the trees. Such a thing as an echo changing its place in this way had never been heard of before, and nobody was able to explain how it could have happened. Old Pipes, however, knew very well that the sound came from the Echo-dwarf shut up in the great oak tree. The sides of the tree were thin, and the sound of the pipes could be heard through them, and the dwarf was obliged by the laws of his being to echo back those notes whenever they came to him. But Old Pipes thought he might get the Dryad in trouble if he let anyone know that the Echo-dwarf was shut up in the tree, and so he wisely said nothing about it.\\n\\nOne day the two boys and the girl who had helped Old Pipes up the hill were playing in the woods. Stopping near the great oak tree, they heard a sound of knocking within it, and then a voice plainly said:\\n\\n\"Let me out! let me out!\"\\n\\nFor a moment the children stood still in astonishment, and then one of the boys exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Oh, it is a Dryad, like the one Old Pipes found! Let\\'s let her out!\"\\n\\n\"What are you thinking of?\" cried the girl. \"I am the oldest of all, and I am only thirteen. Do you wish to be turned into crawling babies? Run! run! run!\"\\n\\nAnd the two boys and the girl dashed down into the valley as fast as their legs could carry them. There was no desire in their youthful hearts to be made younger than they were, and for fear that their parents might think it well that they should commence their careers anew, they never said a word about finding the Dryad tree.\\n\\nAs the summer days went on, Old Pipes\\'s mother grew feebler and feebler. One day when her son was away, for he now frequently went into the woods to hunt or fish, or down into the valley to work, she arose from her knitting to prepare the simple dinner. But she felt so weak and tired that she was not able to do the work to which she had been so long accustomed. \"Alas! alas!\" she said, \"the time has come when I am too old to work. My son will have to hire some one to come here and cook his meals, make his bed, and mend his clothes. Alas! alas! I had hoped that as long as I lived I should be able to do these things. But it is not so. I have grown utterly worthless, and some one else must prepare the dinner for my son. I wonder where he is.\" And tottering to the door, she went outside to look for him. She did not feel able to stand, and reaching the rustic chair, she sank into it, quite exhausted, and soon fell asleep.\\n\\nThe Dryad, who had often come to the cottage to see if she could find an opportunity of carrying out Old Pipes\\'s affectionate design, now happened by; 244 and seeing that the much-desired occasion had come, she stepped up quietly behind the old woman and gently kissed her on each cheek, and then as quietly disappeared.\\n\\nIn a few minutes the mother of Old Pipes awoke, and looking up at the sun, she exclaimed: \"Why, it is almost dinner-time! My son will be here directly, and I am not ready for him.\" And rising to her feet, she hurried into the house, made the fire, set the meat and vegetables to cook, laid the cloth, and by the time her son arrived the meal was on the table.\\n\\n\"How a little sleep does refresh one,\" she said to herself, as she was bustling about. She was a woman of very vigorous constitution, and at seventy had been a great deal stronger and more active than her son was at that age. The moment Old Pipes saw his mother, he knew that the Dryad had been there; but, while he felt as happy as a king, he was too wise to say anything about her.\\n\\n\"It is astonishing how well I feel to-day,\" said his mother; \"and either my hearing has improved or you speak much more plainly than you have done of late.\"\\n\\nThe summer days went on and passed away, the leaves were falling from the trees, and the air was becoming cold.\\n\\n\"Nature has ceased to be lovely,\" said the Dryad, \"and the night winds chill me. It is time for me to go back into my comfortable quarters in the great oak. But first I must pay another visit to the cottage of Old Pipes.\"\\n\\nShe found the piper and his mother sitting side by side on the rock in front of the door. The cattle were not to go to the mountain any more that season, and he was piping them down for the last time. Loud and merrily sounded the pipes of Old Pipes, and down the mountain-side came the cattle, the cows by the easiest paths, the sheep by those not quite so easy, and the goats by the most difficult ones among the rocks; while from the great oak tree were heard the echoes of the cheerful music.\\n\\n\"How happy they look, sitting there together,\" said the Dryad; \"and I don\\'t believe it will do them a bit of harm to be still younger.\" And moving quietly up behind them, she first kissed Old Pipes on his cheek and then kissed his mother.\\n\\nOld Pipes, who had stopped playing, knew what it was, but he did not move, and said nothing. His mother, thinking that her son had kissed her, turned to him with a smile and kissed him in return. And then she arose and went into the cottage, a vigorous woman of sixty, followed by her son, erect and happy, and twenty years younger than herself.\\n\\nThe Dryad sped away to the woods, shrugging her shoulders as she felt the cool evening wind.\\n\\nWhen she reached the great oak, she turned the key and opened the door. \"Come out,\" said she to the Echo-dwarf, who sat blinking within. \"Winter is coming on, and I want the comfortable shelter of my tree for myself. The cattle have come down from the mountain for the last time this year, the pipes will no longer sound, and you can go to your rocks and have a holiday until next spring.\"\\n\\nUpon hearing these words the dwarf skipped quickly out, and the Dryad entered the tree and pulled the door shut after her. \"Now, then,\" she said to herself, \"he can break off the key if he likes. It does not matter to me. 245 Another will grow out next spring. And although the good piper made me no promise, I know that when the warm days arrive next year, he will come and let me out again.\"\\n\\nThe Echo-dwarf did not stop to break the key of the tree. He was too happy to be released to think of anything else, and he hastened as fast as he could to his home on the rocky hill-side.\\n\\nThe Dryad was not mistaken when she trusted in the piper. When the warm days came again he went to the oak tree to let her out. But, to his sorrow and surprise, he found the great tree lying upon the ground. A winter storm had blown it down, and it lay with its trunk shattered and split. And what became of the Dryad no one ever knew.\\n\\n204\\n\\nJohn Ruskin (1819-1900), the most eloquent of English prose writers, was much interested in the question of literature for both grown-ups and children. He edited a reissue of Taylor\\'s translation of Grimms\\' Popular Stories, issued \"Dame Wiggins of Lee and Her Seven Wonderful Cats\" (see No. 143), and wrote that masterpiece among modern stories for children, The King of the Golden River. Its fine idealism, splendidly imagined structure, wonderful word-paintings, and perfect English all combine to justify the high place assigned to it. Ruskin wrote the story in 1841, at a \"couple of sittings,\" though it was not published until ten years later. Speaking of it later in life, he said that it \"was written to amuse a little girl; and being a fairly good imitation of Grimm and Dickens, mixed with a little true Alpine feeling of my own, it has been rightly pleasing to nice children, and good for them. But it is totally valueless, for all that. I can no more write a story than compose a picture.\" The final statement may be taken for what it is worth, written as it was at a time of disillusionment. The first part of Ruskin\\'s analysis is certainly true and has been thus expanded by his biographer, Sir E. T. Cook: \"The grotesque and the German setting of the tale were taken from Grimm; from Dickens it took its tone of pervading kindliness and geniality. The Alpine ecstasy and the eager pressing of the moral were Ruskin\\'s own; and so also is the style, delicately poised between poetry and comedy.\"\\n\\nTHE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER OR THE BLACK BROTHERS\\n\\nJOHN RUSKIN\\n\\nCHAPTER I HOW THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM OF THE BLACK BROTHERS WAS INTERFERED WITH BY SOUTH-WEST WIND, ESQUIRE\\n\\nIn a secluded and mountainous part of Stiria there was, in old time, a valley of the most surprising and luxuriant fertility. It was surrounded, on all sides, by steep and rocky mountains, rising into peaks, which were always covered with snow, and from which a number of torrents descended in constant cataracts. One of these fell westward, over the face of a crag so high, that, when the sun had set to everything else, and all below was darkness, his beams still shone full upon this waterfall, so that it looked like a shower of gold. It was, therefore, called by the people of the neighborhood, the Golden River. It was strange that none of these streams fell into the valley itself. They all descended on the other side of the mountains, and wound away through broad plains and by populous cities. But the clouds were drawn so constantly to the snowy hills, and rested so softly 246 in the circular hollow, that in time of drought and heat, when all the country round was burnt up, there was still rain in the little valley; and its crops were so heavy, and its hay so high, and its apples so red, and its grapes so blue, and its wine so rich, and its honey so sweet, that it was a marvel to every one who beheld it, and was commonly called the Treasure Valley.\\n\\nThe whole of this little valley belonged to three brothers, called Schwartz, Hans, and Gluck. Schwartz and Hans, the two elder brothers, were very ugly men, with overhanging eyebrows and small dull eyes, which were always half shut, so that you couldn\\'t see into them, and always fancied they saw very far into you. They lived by farming the Treasure Valley, and very good farmers they were. They killed everything that did not pay for its eating. They shot the blackbirds because they pecked the fruit; and killed the hedgehogs, lest they should suck the cows; they poisoned the crickets for eating the crumbs in the kitchen; and smothered the cicadas, which used to sing all summer in the lime trees. They worked their servants without any wages, till they would not work any more, and then quarreled with them, and turned them out of doors without paying them. It would have been very odd if, with such a farm, and such a system of farming, they hadn\\'t got very rich; and very rich they did get. They generally contrived to keep their corn by them till it was very dear, and then sell it for twice its value; they had heaps of gold lying about on their floors, yet it was never known that they had given so much as a penny or a crust in charity; they never went to mass; grumbled perpetually at paying tithes; and were, in a word, of so cruel and grinding a temper as to receive from all those with whom they had any dealings the nickname of the \"Black Brothers.\"\\n\\nThe youngest brother, Gluck, was as completely opposed, in both appearance and character, to his seniors as could possibly be imagined or desired. He was not above twelve years old, fair, blue-eyed, and kind in temper to every living thing. He did not, of course, agree particularly well with his brothers, or rather, they did not agree with him. He was usually appointed to the honorable office of turnspit, when there was anything to roast, which was not often; for, to do the brothers justice, they were hardly less sparing upon themselves than upon other people. At other times he used to clean the shoes, floors, and sometimes the plates, occasionally getting what was left on them, by way of encouragement, and a wholesome quantity of dry blows, by way of education.\\n\\nThings went on in this manner for a long time. At last came a very wet summer, and everything went wrong in the country around. The hay had hardly been got in, when the haystacks were floated bodily down to the sea by an inundation; the vines were cut to pieces with the hail; the corn was all killed by a black blight; only in the Treasure Valley, as usual, all was safe. As it had rain when there was rain nowhere else, so it had sun when there was sun nowhere else. Everybody came to buy corn at the farm, and went away pouring maledictions on the Black Brothers. They asked what they liked, and got it, except from the poor people, who could only beg, and several of whom were starved at their very door, without the slightest regard or notice. 247\\n\\nIt was drawing towards winter, and very cold weather, when one day the two elder brothers had gone out, with their usual warning to little Gluck, who was left to mind the roast, that he was to let nobody in, and give nothing out. Gluck sat down quite close to the fire, for it was raining very hard, and the kitchen walls were by no means dry or comfortable looking. He turned and turned, and the roast got nice and brown. \"What a pity,\" thought Gluck, \"my brothers never ask anybody to dinner. I\\'m sure, when they\\'ve got such a nice piece of mutton as this, and nobody else has got so much as a piece of dry bread, it would do their hearts good to have somebody to eat it with them.\"\\n\\nJust as he spoke, there came a double knock at the house door, yet heavy and dull, as though the knocker had been tied up—more like a puff than a knock.\\n\\n\"It must be the wind,\" said Gluck; \"nobody else would venture to knock double knocks at our door.\"\\n\\nNo; it wasn\\'t the wind; there it came again very hard, and what was particularly astounding, the knocker seemed to be in a hurry, and not to be in the least afraid of the consequences. Gluck went to the window, opened it, and put his head out to see who it was.\\n\\nIt was the most extraordinary looking little gentleman he had ever seen in his life. He had a very large nose, slightly brass-colored; his cheeks were very round, and very red, and might have warranted a supposition that he had been blowing a refractory fire for the last eight-and-forty hours; his eyes twinkled merrily through long silky eyelashes, his mustaches curled twice round like a corkscrew on each side of his mouth, and his hair, of a curious mixed pepper-and-salt color, descended far over his shoulders. He was about four-feet-six in height, and wore a conical pointed cap of nearly the same altitude, decorated with a black feather some three feet long. His doublet was prolonged behind into something resembling a violent exaggeration of what is now termed a \"swallowtail,\" but was much obscured by the swelling folds of an enormous black, glossy-looking cloak, which must have been very much too long in calm weather, as the wind, whistling round the old house, carried it clear out from the wearer\\'s shoulders to about four times his own length.\\n\\nGluck was so perfectly paralyzed by the singular appearance of his visitor, that he remained fixed without uttering a word, until the old gentleman, having performed another, and a more energetic concerto on the knocker, turned round to look after his fly-away cloak. In so doing he caught sight of Gluck\\'s little yellow head jammed in the window, with its mouth and eyes very wide open indeed.\\n\\n\"Hollo!\" said the little gentleman, \"that\\'s not the way to answer the door: I\\'m wet; let me in!\"\\n\\nTo do the little gentleman justice, he was wet. His feather hung down between his legs like a beaten puppy\\'s tail, dripping like an umbrella; and from the ends of his mustaches the water was running into his waistcoat pockets, and out again like a mill stream.\\n\\n\"I beg pardon, sir,\" said Gluck, \"I\\'m very sorry, but I really can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t what?\" said the old gentleman.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t let you in, sir,—I can\\'t indeed; my brothers would beat me to death, sir, if I thought of such a thing. What do you want, sir?\" 248\\n\\n\"Want?\" said the old gentleman, petulantly. \"I want fire, and shelter; and there\\'s your great fire there blazing, crackling, and dancing on the walls, with nobody to feel it. Let me in, I say; I only want to warm myself.\"\\n\\nGluck had had his head, by this time, so long out of the window, that he began to feel it was really unpleasantly cold, and when he turned, and saw the beautiful fire rustling and roaring, and throwing long bright tongues up the chimney, as if it were licking its chops at the savory smell of the leg of mutton, his heart melted within him that it should be burning away for nothing. \"He does look very wet,\" said little Gluck; \"I\\'ll just let him in for a quarter of an hour.\" Round he went to the door, and opened it; and as the little gentleman walked in, there came a gust of wind through the house that made the old chimneys totter.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a good boy,\" said the little gentleman. \"Never mind your brothers. I\\'ll talk to them.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, sir, don\\'t do any such thing,\" said Gluck. \"I can\\'t let you stay till they come; they\\'d be the death of me.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me,\" said the old gentleman, \"I\\'m very sorry to hear that. How long may I stay?\"\\n\\n\"Only till the mutton\\'s done, sir,\" replied Gluck, \"and it\\'s very brown.\"\\n\\nThen the old gentleman walked into the kitchen, and sat himself down on the hob, with the top of his cap accommodated up the chimney, for it was a great deal too high for the roof.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll soon dry there, sir,\" said Gluck, and sat down again to turn the mutton. But the old gentleman did not dry there, but went on drip, drip, dripping among the cinders, and the fire fizzed and sputtered, and began to look very black and uncomfortable; never was such a cloak; every fold in it ran like a gutter.\\n\\n\"I beg pardon, sir,\" said Gluck at length, after watching the water spreading in long, quicksilver-like streams over the floor for a quarter of an hour; \"mayn\\'t I take your cloak?\"\\n\\n\"No thank you,\" said the old gentleman.\\n\\n\"Your cap, sir?\"\\n\\n\"I am all right, thank you,\" said the old gentleman rather gruffly.\\n\\n\"But—sir—I\\'m very sorry,\" said Gluck hesitatingly; \"but—really, sir—you\\'re—putting the fire out.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'ll take longer to do the mutton, then,\" replied his visitor dryly.\\n\\nGluck was very much puzzled by the behavior of his guest; it was such a strange mixture of coolness and humility. He turned away at the string meditatively for another five minutes.\\n\\n\"That mutton looks very nice,\" said the old gentleman at length. \"Can\\'t you give me a little bit?\"\\n\\n\"Impossible, sir,\" said Gluck.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very hungry,\" continued the old gentleman; \"I\\'ve had nothing to eat yesterday nor to-day. They surely couldn\\'t miss a bit from the knuckle!\"\\n\\nHe spoke in so very melancholy a tone that it quite melted Gluck\\'s heart. \"They promised me one slice to-day, sir,\" said he; \"I can give you that, but not a bit more.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a good boy,\" said the old gentleman again.\\n\\nThen Gluck warmed a plate, and sharpened a knife. \"I don\\'t care if I do get beaten for it,\" thought he. Just as he had cut a large slice out of the mutton, there came a tremendous rap at the door. The old gentleman jumped 249 off the hob, as if it had suddenly become inconveniently warm. Gluck fitted the slice into the mutton again, with desperate efforts at exactitude, and ran to open the door.\\n\\n\"What did you keep us waiting in the rain for?\" said Schwartz, as he walked in, throwing his umbrella in Gluck\\'s face. \"Ay! what for, indeed, you little vagabond?\" said Hans, administering an educational box on the ear, as he followed his brother into the kitchen.\\n\\n\"Bless my soul!\" said Schwartz when he opened the door.\\n\\n\"Amen,\" said the little gentleman, who had taken his cap off and was standing in the middle of the kitchen, bowing with the utmost possible velocity.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s that?\" said Schwartz, catching up a rolling-pin, and turning to Gluck with a fierce frown.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, indeed, brother,\" said Gluck in great terror.\\n\\n\"How did he get in?\" roared Schwartz.\\n\\n\"My dear brother,\" said Gluck, deprecatingly, \"he was so very wet!\"\\n\\nThe rolling-pin was descending on Gluck\\'s head; but, at the instant, the old gentleman interposed his conical cap, on which it crashed with a shock that shook the water out of it all over the room. What was very odd, the rolling pin no sooner touched the cap, than it flew out of Schwartz\\'s hand, spinning like a straw in a high wind, and fell into the corner at the farther end of the room.\\n\\n\"Who are you, sir?\" demanded Schwartz, turning upon him.\\n\\n\"What\\'s your business?\" snarled Hans.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a poor old man, sir,\" the little gentleman began very modestly, \"and I saw your fire through the window, and begged shelter for a quarter of an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Have the goodness to walk out again, then,\" said Schwartz. \"We\\'ve quite enough water in our kitchen, without making it a drying house.\"\\n\\n\"It is a cold day to turn an old man out in, sir; look at my gray hairs.\" They hung down to his shoulders, as I told you before.\\n\\n\"Ay!\" said Hans, \"there are enough of them to keep you warm. Walk!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m very, very hungry, sir; couldn\\'t you spare me a bit of bread before I go?\"\\n\\n\"Bread, indeed!\" said Schwartz; \"do you suppose we\\'ve nothing to do with our bread but to give it to such red-nosed fellows as you?\"\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you sell your feather?\" said Hans, sneeringly. \"Out with you!\"\\n\\n\"A little bit,\" said the old gentleman.\\n\\n\"Be off!\" said Schwartz.\\n\\n\"Pray, gentlemen—\"\\n\\n\"Off, and be hanged!\" cried Hans, seizing him by the collar. But he had no sooner touched the old gentleman\\'s collar, than away he went after the rolling-pin, spinning round and round, till he fell into the corner on the top of it. Then Schwartz was very angry, and ran at the old gentleman to turn him out; but he also had hardly touched him, when away he went after Hans and the rolling-pin, and hit his head against the wall as he tumbled into the corner. And so there they lay, all three.\\n\\nThen the old gentleman spun himself round with velocity in the opposite direction; continued to spin until his long cloak was all wound neatly about him, clapped his cap on his head, very much on one side (for it could not stand upright without going through the ceiling), gave an additional twist to his corkscrew mustaches, and replied with perfect coolness: \"Gentlemen, I wish you 250 a very good morning. At twelve o\\'clock to-night I\\'ll call again; after such a refusal of hospitality as I have just experienced, you will not be surprised if that visit is the last I ever pay you.\"\\n\\n\"If ever I catch you here again,\" muttered Schwartz, coming, half frightened, out of the corner—but, before he could finish his sentence, the old gentleman had shut the house door behind him with a great bang: and there drove past the window, at the same instant, a wreath of ragged cloud that whirled and rolled away down the valley in all manner of shapes; turning over and over in the air, and melting away at last in a gush of rain.\\n\\n\"A very pretty business, indeed, Mr. Gluck!\" said Schwartz. \"Dish the mutton, sir. If ever I catch you at such a trick again—bless me, why the mutton\\'s been cut!\"\\n\\n\"You promised me one slice, brother, you know,\" said Gluck.\\n\\n\"Oh! and you were cutting it hot, I suppose, and going to catch all the gravy. It\\'ll be long before I promise you such a thing again. Leave the room, sir; and have the kindness to wait in the coal-cellar till I call you.\"\\n\\nGluck left the room melancholy enough. The brothers ate as much mutton as they could, locked the rest in the cupboard, and proceeded to get very drunk after dinner.\\n\\nSuch a night as it was! Howling wind and rushing rain, without intermission! The brothers had just sense enough left to put up all the shutters, and double bar the door, before they went to bed. They usually slept in the same room. As the clock struck twelve, they were both awakened by a tremendous crash. Their door burst open with a violence that shook the house from top to bottom.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" cried Schwartz, starting up in his bed.\\n\\n\"Only I,\" said the little gentleman.\\n\\nThe two brothers sat up on their bolster and stared into the darkness. The room was full of water, and by a misty moonbeam, which found its way through a hole in the shutter, they could see in the midst of it an enormous foam globe, spinning round, and bobbing up and down like a cork, on which, as on a most luxurious cushion, reclined the little old gentleman, cap and all. There was plenty of room for it now, for the roof was off.\\n\\n\"Sorry to incommode you,\" said their visitor, ironically. \"I\\'m afraid your beds are dampish; perhaps you had better go to your brother\\'s room; I\\'ve left the ceiling on, there.\"\\n\\nThey required no second admonition, but rushed into Gluck\\'s room, wet through, and in an agony of terror.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll find my card on the kitchen table,\" the old gentleman called after them. \"Remember, the last visit.\"\\n\\n\"Pray Heaven it may!\" said Schwartz, shuddering. And the foam globe disappeared.\\n\\nDawn came at last, and the two brothers looked out of Gluck\\'s little window in the morning. The Treasure Valley was one mass of ruin and desolation. The inundation had swept away trees, crops, and cattle, and left in their stead a waste of red sand and gray mud. The two brothers crept shivering and horror-struck into the kitchen. The water had gutted the whole first floor; corn, money, almost every movable thing had been swept away, and there was left only a small white card on the kitchen table. On it, in large, breezy 251 long-legged letters, were engraved the words:—\\n\\nSouth-West Wind, Esquire.\\n\\nCHAPTER II OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER THE VISIT OF SOUTH-WEST WIND, ESQUIRE; AND HOW LITTLE GLUCK HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER\\n\\nSouth-West Wind, Esquire, was as good as his word. After the momentous visit above related, he entered the Treasure Valley no more; and, what was worse, he had so much influence with his relations, the West Winds in general, and used it so effectually, that they all adopted a similar line of conduct. So no rain fell in the valley from one year\\'s end to another. Though everything remained green and flourishing in the plains below, the inheritance of the Three Brothers was a desert. What had once been the richest soil in the kingdom, became a shifting heap of red sand; and the brothers, unable longer to contend with the adverse skies, abandoned their valueless patrimony in despair, to seek some means of gaining a livelihood among the cities and people of the plains. All their money was gone, and they had nothing left but some curious, old-fashioned pieces of gold plates, the last remnants of their ill-gotten wealth.\\n\\n\"Suppose we turn goldsmiths?\" said Schwartz to Hans, as they entered the large city. \"It is a good knave\\'s trade; we can put a great deal of copper into the gold, without any one\\'s finding it out.\"\\n\\nThe thought was agreed to be a very good one; they hired a furnace, and turned goldsmiths. But two slight circumstances affected their trade; the first, that people did not approve of the coppered gold; the second, that the two elder brothers, whenever they had sold anything, used to leave little Gluck to mind the furnace, and go and drink out the money in the ale-house next door. So they melted all their gold, without making money enough to buy more, and were at last reduced to one large drinking mug, which an uncle of his had given to little Gluck, and which he was very fond of, and would not have parted with for the world; though he never drank anything out of it but milk and water. The mug was a very odd mug to look at. The handle was formed of two wreaths of flowing golden hair, so finely spun that it looked more like silk than metal, and these wreaths descended into, and mixed with, a beard and whiskers of the same exquisite workmanship, which surrounded and decorated a very fierce little face, of the reddest gold imaginable, right in the front of the mug, with a pair of eyes in it which seemed to command its whole circumference. It was impossible to drink out of the mug without being subjected to an intense gaze out of the side of these eyes; and Schwartz positively averred that once, after emptying it, full of Rhenish, seventeen times, he had seen them wink! When it came to the mug\\'s turn to be made into spoons, it half broke poor little Gluck\\'s heart; but the brothers only laughed at him, tossed the mug into the melting-pot, and staggered out to the ale-house; leaving him, as usual, to pour the gold into bars, when it was all ready.\\n\\nWhen they were gone, Gluck took a farewell look at his old friend in the melting-pot. The flowing hair was all gone; nothing remained but the red nose, 252 and the sparkling eyes, which looked more malicious than ever. \"And no wonder,\" thought Gluck, \"after being treated in that way.\" He sauntered disconsolately to the window, and sat himself down to catch the fresh evening air, and escape the hot breath of the furnace. Now this window commanded a direct view of the range of mountains, which, as I told you before, overhung the Treasure Valley, and more especially of the peak from which fell the Golden River. It was just at the close of the day, and when Gluck sat down at the window, he saw the rocks of the mountain tops, all crimson and purple with the sunset; and there were bright tongues of fiery cloud burning and quivering about them; and the river, brighter than all, fell, in a waving column of pure gold, from precipice to precipice, with the double arch of a broad purple rainbow stretched across it, flushing and fading alternately in the wreaths of spray.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Gluck aloud, after he had looked at it for a while, \"if that river were really all gold, what a nice thing it would be.\"\\n\\n\"No, it wouldn\\'t, Gluck,\" said a clear metallic voice, close at his ear.\\n\\n\"Bless me! what\\'s that?\" exclaimed Gluck, jumping up. There was nobody there. He looked round the room, and under the table, and a great many times behind him, but there was certainly nobody there, and he sat down again at the window. This time he didn\\'t speak, but he couldn\\'t help thinking again that it would be very convenient if the river were really all gold.\\n\\n\"Not at all, my boy,\" said the same voice, louder than before.\\n\\n\"Bless me!\" said Gluck again; \"what is that?\" He looked again into all the corners, and cupboards, and then began turning round, and round, as fast as he could in the middle of the room, thinking there was somebody behind him, when the same voice struck again on his ear. It was singing now very merrily, \"Lala-lira-la\"; no words, only a soft running effervescent melody, something like that of a kettle on the boil. Gluck looked out of the window. No, it was certainly in the house. Upstairs, and downstairs. No, it was certainly in that very room, coming in quicker time, and clearer notes, every moment. \"Lala-lira-la.\" All at once it struck Gluck that it sounded louder near the furnace. He ran to the opening, and looked in; yes, he saw right, it seemed to be coming, not only out of the furnace, but out of the pot. He uncovered it, and ran back in a great fright, for the pot was certainly singing! He stood in the farthest corner of the room, with his hands up, and his mouth open, for a minute or two, when the singing stopped, and the voice became clear, and pronunciative.\\n\\n\"Hollo!\" said the voice.\\n\\nGluck made no answer.\\n\\n\"Hollo! Gluck, my boy,\" said the pot again.\\n\\nGluck summoned all his energies, walked straight up to the crucible, drew it out of the furnace, and looked in. The gold was all melted, and its surface as smooth and polished as a river; but instead of reflecting little Gluck\\'s head, as he looked in, he saw, meeting his glance from beneath the gold, the red nose and sharp eyes of his old friend of the mug, a thousand times redder and sharper than ever he had seen them in his life.\\n\\n\"Come, Gluck, my boy,\" said the voice out of the pot again, \"I\\'m all right; pour me out.\" 253\\n\\nBut Gluck was too much astonished to do anything of the kind.\\n\\n\"Pour me out, I say,\" said the voice rather gruffly.\\n\\nStill Gluck couldn\\'t move.\\n\\n\"Will you pour me out?\" said the voice passionately. \"I\\'m too hot.\"\\n\\nBy a violent effort, Gluck recovered the use of his limbs, took hold of the crucible, and sloped it so as to pour out the gold. But instead of a liquid stream, there came out, first, a pair of pretty little yellow legs, then some coat tails, then a pair of arms stuck a-kimbo, and, finally, the well-known head of his friend the mug; all which articles, uniting as they rolled out, stood up energetically on the floor, in the shape of a little golden dwarf, about a foot and a half high.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right!\" said the dwarf, stretching out first his legs and then his arms, and then shaking his head up and down, and as far round as it would go, for five minutes, without stopping; apparently with the view of ascertaining if he were quite correctly put together, while Gluck stood contemplating him in speechless amazement. He was dressed in a slashed doublet of spun gold, so fine in its texture that the prismatic colors gleamed over it, as if on a surface of mother of pearl; and, over this brilliant doublet, his hair and beard fell full halfway to the ground in waving curls so exquisitely delicate that Gluck could hardly tell where they ended; they seemed to melt into air. The features of the face, however, were by no means finished with the same delicacy; they were rather coarse, slightly inclining to coppery in complexion, and indicative, in expression, of a very pertinacious and intractable disposition in their small proprietor. When the dwarf had finished his self-examination, he turned his small sharp eyes full on Gluck and stared at him deliberately for a minute or two. \"No, it wouldn\\'t, Gluck, my boy,\" said the little man.\\n\\nThis was certainly rather an abrupt and unconnected mode of commencing conversation. It might indeed be supposed to refer to the course of Gluck\\'s thoughts, which had first produced the dwarf\\'s observations out of the pot; but whatever it referred to, Gluck had no inclination to dispute the dictum.\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t it, sir?\" said Gluck, very mildly and submissively indeed.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the dwarf, conclusively. \"No, it wouldn\\'t.\" And with that, the dwarf pulled his cap hard over his brows, and took two turns, of three feet long, up and down the room, lifting his legs up very high, and setting them down very hard. This pause gave time for Gluck to collect his thoughts a little, and, seeing no great reason to view his diminutive visitor with dread, and feeling his curiosity overcome his amazement, he ventured on a question of peculiar delicacy.\\n\\n\"Pray, sir,\" said Gluck rather hesitatingly, \"were you my mug?\"\\n\\nOn which the little man turned sharp round, walked straight up to Gluck, and drew himself up to his full height. \"I,\" said the little man, \"am the King of the Golden River.\" Whereupon he turned about again, and took two more turns, some six feet long, in order to allow time for the consternation which this announcement produced in his auditor to evaporate. After which, he again walked up to Gluck and stood still, as if expecting some comment on his communication.\\n\\nGluck determined to say something at all events. \"I hope your Majesty is very well,\" said Gluck. 254\\n\\n\"Listen!\" said the little man, deigning no reply to this polite inquiry. \"I am the King of what you mortals call the Golden River. The shape you saw me in, was owing to the malice of a stronger king, from whose enchantments you have this instant freed me. What I have seen of you, and your conduct to your wicked brothers, renders me willing to serve you; therefore, attend to what I tell you. Whoever shall climb to the top of that mountain from which you see the Golden River issue, and shall cast into the stream at its source three drops of holy water, for him, and for him only, the river shall turn to gold. But no one failing in his first, can succeed in a second attempt; and if any one shall cast unholy water into the river, it will overwhelm him, and he will become a black stone.\" So saying, the King of the Golden River turned away and deliberately walked into the center of the hottest flame of the furnace. His figure became red, white, transparent, dazzling—a blaze of intense light—rose, trembled, and disappeared. The King of the Golden River had evaporated.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried poor Gluck, running to look up the chimney after him; \"Oh, dear, dear, dear me! My mug! my mug! my mug!\"\\n\\nCHAPTER III HOW MR. HANS SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE PROSPERED THEREIN\\n\\nThe King of the Golden River had hardly made the extraordinary exit, related in the last chapter, before Hans and Schwartz came roaring into the house, very savagely drunk. The discovery of the total loss of their last piece of plate had the effect of sobering them just enough to enable them to stand over Gluck, beating him very steadily for a quarter of an hour; at the expiration of which period they dropped into a couple of chairs, and requested to know what he had got to say for himself. Gluck told them his story, of which, of course, they did not believe a word. They beat him again, till their arms were tired, and staggered to bed. In the morning, however, the steadiness with which he adhered to his story obtained him some degree of credence; the immediate consequence of which was, that the two brothers, after wrangling a long time on the knotty question, which of them should try his fortune first, drew their swords and began fighting. The noise of the fray alarmed the neighbors, who, finding they could not pacify the combatants, sent for the constable.\\n\\nHans, on hearing this, contrived to escape, and hid himself; but Schwartz was taken before the magistrate, fined for breaking the peace, and, having drunk out his last penny the evening before, was thrown into prison till he should pay.\\n\\nWhen Hans heard this, he was much delighted, and determined to set out immediately for the Golden River. How to get the holy water was the question. He went to the priest, but the priest could not give any holy water to so abandoned a character. So Hans went to vespers in the evening for the first time in his life, and, under pretense of crossing himself, stole a cupful, and returned home in triumph.\\n\\nNext morning he got up before the sun rose, put the holy water into a strong flask, and two bottles of wine and some meat in a basket, slung them over his back, took his alpine staff in his hand, and set off for the mountains.\\n\\nOn his way out of the town he had to pass the prison, and as he looked in at the windows, whom should he see but Schwartz himself peeping out of the bars, and looking very disconsolate.\\n\\n\"Good morning, brother,\" said Hans; \"have you any message for the King of the Golden River?\"\\n\\nSchwartz gnashed his teeth with rage, and shook the bars with all his strength; but Hans only laughed at him, and advising him to make himself comfortable till he came back again, shouldered his basket, shook the bottle of holy water in Schwartz\\'s face till it frothed again, and marched off in the highest spirits in the world.\\n\\nIt was, indeed, a morning that might have made any one happy, even with no Golden River to seek for. Level lines of dewy mist lay stretched along the valley, out of which rose the massy mountains—their lower cliffs in pale gray shadow, hardly distinguishable from the floating vapor, but gradually ascending till they caught the sunlight, which ran in sharp touches of ruddy color along the angular crags, and pierced, in long level rays, through their fringes of spear-like pine. Far above, shot up red splintered masses of castellated rock, jagged and shivered into myriads of fantastic forms, with here and there a streak of sunlit snow, traced down their chasms like a line of forked lightning; and, far beyond, and far above all these, fainter than the morning cloud, but purer and changeless, slept, in the blue sky, the utmost peaks of the eternal snow.\\n\\nThe Golden River, which sprang from one of the lower and snowless elevations, was now nearly in shadow; all but the uppermost jets of spray, which rose like slow smoke above the undulating line of the cataract, and floated away in feeble wreaths upon the morning wind.\\n\\nOn this object, and on this alone, Hans\\'s eyes and thoughts were fixed; forgetting the distance he had to traverse, he set off at an imprudent rate of walking, which greatly exhausted him before he had scaled the first range of the green and low hills. He was, moreover, surprised, on surmounting them, to find that a large glacier, of whose existence, notwithstanding his previous knowledge of the mountains, he had been absolutely ignorant, lay between him and the source of the Golden River. He entered on it with the boldness of a practised mountaineer; yet he thought he had never traversed so strange or so dangerous a glacier in his life. The ice was excessively slippery, and out of all its chasms came wild sounds of gushing water; not monotonous or low, but changeful and loud, rising occasionally into drifting passages of wild melody; then breaking off into short melancholy tones, or sudden shrieks, resembling those of human voices in distress or pain. The ice was broken into thousands of confused shapes, but none, Hans thought, like the ordinary forms of splintered ice. There seemed a curious expression about all their outlines—a perpetual resemblance to living features, distorted and scornful. Myriads of deceitful shadows, and lurid lights, played and floated about and through the pale blue pinnacles, dazzling and confusing the sight of the traveler; while his ears grew dull and his head giddy with the constant gush and roar of the concealed waters. These painful circumstances increased upon him as he advanced; the ice crashed and yawned into fresh chasms at his feet, tottering spires nodded around him, and 256 fell thundering across his path; and though he had repeatedly faced these dangers on the most terrific glaciers, and in the wildest weather, it was with a new and oppressive feeling of panic terror that he leaped the last chasm, and flung himself, exhausted and shuddering, on the firm turf of the mountain.\\n\\nHe had been compelled to abandon his basket of food, which became a perilous encumbrance on the glacier, and had now no means of refreshing himself but by breaking off and eating some of the pieces of ice. This, however, relieved his thirst; an hour\\'s repose recruited his hardy frame, and with the indomitable spirit of avarice, he resumed his laborious journey.\\n\\nHis way now lay straight up a ridge of bare red rocks, without a blade of grass to ease the foot, or a projecting angle to afford an inch of shade from the south sun. It was past noon, and the rays beat intensely upon the steep path, while the whole atmosphere was motionless and penetrated with heat. Intense thirst was soon added to the bodily fatigue with which Hans was now afflicted; glance after glance he cast on the flask of water which hung at his belt. \"Three drops are enough,\" at last thought he; \"I may, at least, cool my lips with it.\"\\n\\nHe opened the flask, and was raising it to his lips, when his eye fell on an object lying on the rock beside him; he thought it moved. It was a small dog, apparently in the last agony of death from thirst. Its tongue was out, its jaws dry, its limbs extended lifelessly, and a swarm of black ants were crawling about its lips and throat. Its eye moved to the bottle which Hans held in his hand. He raised it, drank, spurned the animal with his foot, and passed on. And he did not know how it was, but he thought that a strange shadow had suddenly come across the blue sky.\\n\\nThe path became steeper and more rugged every moment; and the high hill air, instead of refreshing him, seemed to throw his blood into a fever. The noise of the hill cataracts sounded like mockery in his ears; they were all distant, and his thirst increased every moment. Another hour passed, and he again looked down to the flask at his side; it was half empty, but there was much more than three drops in it. He stopped to open it; and again, as he did so, something moved in the path above him. It was a fair child, stretched nearly lifeless on the rock, its breast heaving with thirst, its eyes closed, and its lips parched and burning. Hans eyed it deliberately, drank, and passed on. And a dark gray cloud came over the sun, and long, snake-like shadows crept up along the mountain sides. Hans struggled on. The sun was sinking, but its descent seemed to bring no coolness; the leaden weight of the dead air pressed upon his brow and heart, but the goal was near. He saw the cataract of the Golden River springing from the hillside, scarcely five hundred feet above him. He paused for a moment to breathe, and sprang on to complete his task.\\n\\nAt this instant a faint cry fell on his ear. He turned, and saw a gray-haired old man extended on the rocks. His eyes were sunk, his features deadly pale, and gathered into an expression of despair. \"Water!\" he stretched his arms to Hans, and cried feebly, \"Water! I am dying.\"\\n\\n\"I have none,\" replied Hans; \"thou hast had thy share of life.\" He strode over the prostrate body, and darted on. And a flash of blue lightning rose out of the East, shaped like a sword; it shook 257 thrice over the whole heaven, and left it dark with one heavy, impenetrable shade. The sun was setting; it plunged toward the horizon like a red-hot ball.\\n\\nThe roar of the Golden River rose on Hans\\'s ear. He stood at the brink of the chasm through which it ran. Its waves were filled with the red glory of the sunset; they shook their crests like tongues of fire, and flashes of bloody light gleamed along their foam. Their sound came mightier and mightier on his senses; his brain grew giddy with the prolonged thunder. Shuddering he drew the flask from his girdle, and hurled it into the center of the torrent. As he did so, an icy chill shot through his limbs; he staggered, shrieked, and fell. The waters closed over his cry. And the moaning of the river rose wildly into the night, as it gushed over\\n\\nThe Black Stone.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV HOW MR. SCHWARTZ SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE PROSPERED THEREIN\\n\\nPoor little Gluck waited very anxiously alone in the house for Hans\\'s return. Finding he did not come back, he was terribly frightened and went and told Schwartz in the prison, all that had happened. Then Schwartz was very much pleased, and said that Hans must certainly have been turned into a black stone, and he should have all the gold to himself. But Gluck was very sorry, and cried all night. When he got up in the morning there was no bread in the house, nor any money; so Gluck went and hired himself to another goldsmith, and he worked so hard, and so neatly, and so long every day, that he soon got money enough together to pay his brother\\'s fine, and he went and gave it all to Schwartz, and Schwartz got out of prison. Then Schwartz was quite pleased, and said he should have some of the gold of the river. But Gluck only begged he would go and see what had become of Hans.\\n\\nNow when Schwartz had heard that Hans had stolen the holy water, he thought to himself that such a proceeding might not be considered altogether correct by the King of the Golden River, and determined to manage matters better. So he took some more of Gluck\\'s money, and went to a bad priest, who gave him some holy water very readily for it. Then Schwartz was sure it was all quite right. So Schwartz got up early in the morning before the sun rose, and took some bread and wine, in a basket, and put his holy water in a flask, and set off for the mountains. Like his brother, he was much surprised at the sight of the glacier, and had great difficulty in crossing it, even after leaving his basket behind him. The day was cloudless, but not bright; there was a heavy purple haze hanging over the sky, and the hills looked lowering and gloomy. And as Schwartz climbed the steep rock path, the thirst came upon him, as it had upon his brother, until he lifted his flask to his lips to drink. Then he saw the fair child lying near him on the rocks, and it cried to him, and moaned for water.\\n\\n\"Water, indeed,\" said Schwartz; \"I haven\\'t half enough for myself,\" and passed on. And as he went he thought the sunbeams grew more dim, and he saw a low bank of black cloud rising out of the West; and, when he had climbed for another hour the thirst overcame him again, and he would have drunk. 258 Then he saw the old man lying before him on the path, and heard him cry out for water. \"Water, indeed,\" said Schwartz, \"I haven\\'t enough for myself,\" and on he went.\\n\\nThen again the light seemed to fade before his eyes, and he looked up, and, behold, a mist, of the color of blood, had come over the sun; and the bank of black cloud had risen very high, and its edges were tossing and tumbling like the waves of the angry sea. And they cast long shadows, which flickered over Schwartz\\'s path.\\n\\nThen Schwartz climbed for another hour, and again his thirst returned; and as he lifted his flask to his lips, he thought he saw his brother Hans lying exhausted on the path before him, and, as he gazed, the figure stretched its arms to him, and cried for water. \"Ha, ha,\" laughed Schwartz, \"are you there? Remember the prison bars, my boy. Water, indeed! do you suppose I carried it all the way up here for you?\" And he strode over the figure; yet, as he passed, he thought he saw a strange expression of mockery about its lips. And, when he had gone a few yards farther, he looked back; but the figure was not there.\\n\\nAnd a sudden horror came over Schwartz, he knew not why; but the thirst for gold prevailed over his fear, and he rushed on. And the bank of black cloud rose to the zenith, and out of it came bursts of spiry lightning, and waves of darkness seemed to heave and float between their flashes over the whole heavens. And the sky where the sun was setting was all level, and like a lake of blood; and a strong wind came out of that sky, tearing its crimson cloud into fragments, and scattering them far into the darkness. And when Schwartz stood by the brink of the Golden River, its waves were black, like thunder clouds, but their foam was like fire; and the roar of the waters below, and the thunder above, met, as he cast the flask into the stream. And, as he did so, the lightning glared into his eyes, and the earth gave way beneath him, and the waters closed over his cry. And the moaning of the river rose wildly into the night, as it gushed over the\\n\\nTwo Black Stones.\\n\\nCHAPTER V HOW LITTLE GLUCK SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE PROSPERED THEREIN; WITH OTHER MATTERS OF INTEREST\\n\\nWhen Gluck found that Schwartz did not come back he was very sorry, and did not know what to do. He had no money, and was obliged to go and hire himself again to the goldsmith, who worked him very hard, and gave him very little money. So, after a month or two, Gluck grew tired, and made up his mind to go and try his fortune with the Golden River. \"The little King looked very kind,\" thought he. \"I don\\'t think he will turn me into a black stone.\" So he went to the priest, and the priest gave him some holy water as soon as he asked for it. Then Gluck took some bread in his basket, and the bottle of water, and set off very early for the mountains.\\n\\nIf the glacier had occasioned a great deal of fatigue to his brothers, it was twenty times worse for him, who was neither so strong nor so practised on the mountains. He had several bad falls, lost his basket and bread, and was very much frightened at the strange noises under the ice. He lay a long time to rest on the grass, after he had got over, 259 and began to climb the hill just in the hottest part of the day. When he had climbed for an hour, he got dreadfully thirsty, and was going to drink like his brothers, when he saw an old man coming down the path above him, looking very feeble, and leaning on a staff. \"My son,\" said the old man, \"I am faint with thirst. Give me some of that water.\" Then Gluck looked at him, and when he saw that he was pale and weary, he gave him the water; \"Only pray don\\'t drink it all,\" said Gluck. But the old man drank a great deal, and gave him back the bottle two-thirds empty. Then he bade him good speed, and Gluck went on again merrily. And the path became easier to his feet, and two or three blades of grass appeared upon it, and some grasshoppers began singing on the bank beside it; and Gluck thought he had never heard such merry singing.\\n\\nThen he went on for another hour, and the thirst increased on him so that he thought he should be forced to drink. But, as he raised the flask, he saw a little child lying panting by the road-side, and it cried out piteously for water. Then Gluck struggled with himself, and determined to bear the thirst a little longer; and he put the bottle to the child\\'s lips, and it drank it all but a few drops. Then it smiled on him, and got up and ran down the hill; and Gluck looked after it, till it became as small as a little star, and then turned and began climbing again. And then there were all kinds of sweet flowers growing on the rocks, bright green moss with pale pink starry flowers, and soft belled gentians, more blue than the sky at its deepest, and pure white transparent lilies. And crimson and purple butterflies darted hither and thither, and the sky sent down such pure light that Gluck had never felt so happy in his life.\\n\\nYet, when he had climbed for another hour, his thirst became intolerable again; and, when he looked at his bottle, he saw that there were only five or six drops left in it, and he could not venture to drink. And, as he was hanging the flask to his belt again, he saw a little dog lying on the rocks, gasping for breath—just as Hans had seen it on the day of his ascent. And Gluck stopped and looked at it, and then at the Golden River, not five hundred yards above him; and he thought of the dwarf\\'s words, \"that no one could succeed, except in his first attempt\"; and he tried to pass the dog, but it whined piteously, and Gluck stopped again. \"Poor beastie,\" said Gluck, \"it\\'ll be dead when I come down again, if I don\\'t help it.\" Then he looked closer and closer at it, and its eye turned on him so mournfully that he could not stand it. \"Confound the King and his gold, too,\" said Gluck; and he opened the flask, and poured all the water into the dog\\'s mouth.\\n\\nThe dog sprang up and stood on its hind legs. Its tail disappeared, its ears became long, longer, silky, golden; its nose became very red, its eyes became very twinkling; in three seconds the dog was gone, and before Gluck stood his old acquaintance, the King of the Golden River.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said the monarch; \"but don\\'t be frightened, it\\'s all right\"; for Gluck showed manifest symptoms of consternation at this unlooked-for reply to his last observation. \"Why didn\\'t you come before,\" continued the dwarf, \"instead of sending me those rascally brothers of yours, for me to have the trouble of turning into stones? Very hard stones they make, too.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me!\" said Gluck, \"have you really been so cruel?\"\\n\\n\"Cruel!\" said the dwarf: \"they poured unholy water into my stream; do you suppose I\\'m going to allow that?\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" said Gluck, \"I am sure, sir—your Majesty, I mean,—they got the water out of the church font.\"\\n\\n\"Very probably,\" replied the dwarf; \"but,\" and his countenance grew stern as he spoke, \"the water which has been refused to the cry of the weary and dying is unholy, though it had been blessed by every saint in heaven; and the water which is found in the vessel of mercy is holy, though it had been defiled with corpses.\"\\n\\nSo saying, the dwarf stooped and plucked a lily that grew at his feet. On its white leaves there hung three drops of clear dew. And the dwarf shook them into the flask which Gluck held in his hand. \"Cast these into the river,\" he said, \"and descend on the other side of the mountains into the Treasure Valley, and so good speed.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, the figure of the dwarf became indistinct. The playing colors of his robe formed themselves into a prismatic mist of dewy light: he stood for an instant veiled with them as with the belt of a broad rainbow. The colors grew faint, the mist rose into the air; the monarch had evaporated.\\n\\nAnd Gluck climbed to the brink of the Golden River and its waves were as clear as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun. And, when he cast the three drops of dew into the stream, there opened where they fell, a small circular whirlpool, into which the waters descended with a musical noise.\\n\\nGluck stood watching it for some time, very much disappointed, because not only the river was not turned into gold but its waters seemed much diminished in quantity. Yet he obeyed his friend the dwarf, and descended the other side of the mountains, towards the Treasure Valley; and, as he went, he thought he heard the noise of water working its way under the ground. And when he came in sight of the Treasure Valley, behold, a river, like the Golden River, was springing from a new cleft of the rocks above it, and was flowing in innumerable streams among the dry heaps of red sand.\\n\\nAnd, as Gluck gazed, fresh grass sprang beside the new streams, and creeping plants grew, and climbed among the moistening soil. Young flowers opened suddenly along the river sides, as stars leap out when twilight is deepening, and thickets of myrtle, and tendrils of vine, cast lengthening shadows over the valley as they grew. And thus the Treasure Valley became a garden again, and the inheritance, which had been lost by cruelty, was regained by love.\\n\\nAnd Gluck went and dwelt in the valley, and the poor were never driven from his door; so that his barns became full of corn, and his house of treasure. And for him, the river had, according to the dwarf\\'s promise, become a River of Gold.\\n\\nAnd, to this day, the inhabitants of the valley point out the place where the three drops of holy dew were cast into the stream, and trace the course of the Golden River under the ground, until it emerges in the Treasure Valley. And at the top of the cataract of the Golden River are still to be seen two black stones, round which the waters howl mournfully every day at sunset; and these stones are still called by the people of the valley\\n\\nThe Black Brothers.')"

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https: //layout-parser.github. io.\\n\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis - Deep Learning - Layout Analysis - Character Recognition - Open Source library - Toolkit.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of document image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classification [11,')"

As a language model integration framework, LangChain\\'s use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.[2]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nLangChain was launched in October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. The project quickly garnered popularity,[3] with improvements from hundreds of contributors on GitHub, trending discussions on Twitter, lively activity on the project\\'s Discord server, many YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San Francisco and London. In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[4][5]\\n\\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) was introduced, which provides a declarative way to define chains of actions.[6][7]\\n\\nIn October 2023 LangChain introduced LangServe, a deployment tool to host LCEL code as a production-ready API.[8]\\n\\nCapabilities\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nLangChain\\'s developers highlight the framework\\'s applicability to use-cases including chatbots,[9] retrieval-augmented generation,[10] document summarization,[11] and synthetic data generation.[12]\\n\\nAs of March 2023, LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azure cloud storage;[13] API wrappers for news, movie information, and weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot learning prompt generation support; finding and summarizing \"todo\" tasks in code; Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization, extraction, and creation; Google Search and Microsoft Bing web search;[14] OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face language models; iFixit repair guides and wikis search and summarization; MapReduce for question answering, combining documents, and question generation; N-gram overlap scoring; PyPDF, pdfminer, fitz, and pymupdf for PDF file text extraction and manipulation; Python and JavaScript code generation, analysis, and debugging; Milvus vector database[15] to store and retrieve vector embeddings; Weaviate vector database[16] to cache embedding and data objects; Redis cache database storage; Python RequestsWrapper and other methods for API requests; SQL and NoSQL databases including JSON support; Streamlit, including for logging; text mapping for k-nearest neighbors search; time zone conversion and calendar operations; tracing and recording stack symbols in threaded and asynchronous subprocess runs; and the Wolfram Alpha website and SDK.[17] As of April 2023, it can read from more than 50 document types and data sources.[18]\\n\\nLangChain tools\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nTool name Account required?

What are agents and workflows? How does LlamaIndex help build them?\\n\\nUse cases\\n\\nWhat kind of apps can you build with LlamaIndex? Who should use it?\\n\\nGetting started\\n\\nGet started in Python or TypeScript in just 5 lines of code!\\n\\nLlamaCloud\\n\\nManaged services for LlamaIndex including LlamaParse, the world\\'s best document parser.\\n\\nCommunity\\n\\nGet help and meet collaborators on Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn, and learn how to contribute to the project.\\n\\nRelated projects\\n\\nCheck out our library of connectors, readers, and other integrations at LlamaHub as well as demos and starter apps like create-llama.\\n\\nIntroduction#\\n\\nWhat is context augmentation?#\\n\\nLLMs offer a natural language interface between humans and data. LLMs come pre-trained on huge amounts of publicly available data, but they are not trained on your data. Your data may be private or specific to the problem you\\'re trying to solve. It\\'s behind APIs, in SQL databases, or trapped in PDFs and slide decks.\\n\\nContext augmentation makes your data available to the LLM to solve the problem at hand. LlamaIndex provides the tools to build any of context-augmentation use case, from prototype to production. Our tools allow you to ingest, parse, index and process your data and quickly implement complex query workflows combining data access with LLM prompting.\\n\\nThe most popular example of context-augmentation is Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG, which combines context with LLMs at inference time.\\n\\nWhat are agents?#\\n\\nAgents are LLM-powered knowledge assistants that use tools to perform tasks like research, data extraction, and more. Agents range from simple question-answering to being able to sense, decide and take actions in order to complete tasks.\\n\\nLlamaIndex provides a framework for building agents including the ability to use RAG pipelines as one of many tools to complete a task.\\n\\nWhat are workflows?#\\n\\nWorkflows are multi-step processes that combine one or more agents, data connectors, and other tools to complete a task. They are event-driven software that allows you to combine RAG data sources and multiple agents to create a complex application that can perform a wide variety of tasks with reflection, error-correction, and other hallmarks of advanced LLM applications. You can then deploy these agentic workflows as production microservices.\\n\\nLlamaIndex is the framework for Context-Augmented LLM Applications#\\n\\nLlamaIndex imposes no restriction on how you use LLMs. You can use LLMs as auto-complete, chatbots, agents, and more. It just makes using them easier. We provide tools like:\\n\\nData connectors ingest your existing data from their native source and format. These could be APIs, PDFs, SQL, and (much) more.\\n\\nData indexes structure your data in intermediate representations that are easy and performant for LLMs to consume.\\n\\nEngines provide natural language access to your data. For example:\\n\\nQuery engines are powerful interfaces for question-answering (e.g. a RAG flow).\\n\\nChat engines are conversational interfaces for multi-message, \"back and forth\" interactions with your data.\\n\\nAgents are LLM-powered knowledge workers augmented by tools, from simple helper functions to API integrations and more.\\n\\nObservability/Evaluation integrations that enable you to rigorously experiment, evaluate, and monitor your app in a virtuous cycle.\\n\\nWorkflows allow you to combine all of the above into an event-driven system far more flexible than other, graph-based approaches.\\n\\nUse cases#\\n\\nSome popular use cases for LlamaIndex and context augmentation in general include:\\n\\nQuestion-Answering (Retrieval-Augmented Generation aka RAG)\\n\\nChatbots\\n\\nDocument Understanding and Data Extraction\\n\\nAutonomous Agents that can perform research and take actions\\n\\nMulti-modal applications that combine text, images, and other data types\\n\\nFine-tuning models on data to improve performance\\n\\nCheck out our use cases documentation for more examples and links to tutorials.\\n\\n👨\\u200d👩\\u200d👧\\u200d👦 Who is LlamaIndex for?#\\n\\nLlamaIndex provides tools for beginners, advanced users, and everyone in between.\\n\\nOur high-level API allows beginner users to use LlamaIndex to ingest and query their data in 5 lines of code.\\n\\nFor more complex applications, our lower-level APIs allow advanced users to customize and extend any module -- data connectors, indices, retrievers, query engines, and reranking modules -- to fit their needs.\\n\\nGetting Started#\\n\\nLlamaIndex is available in Python (these docs) and Typescript. If you\\'re not sure where to start, we recommend reading how to read these docs which will point you to the right place based on your experience level.\\n\\n30 second quickstart#\\n\\nSet an environment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY with an OpenAI API key. Install the Python library:\\n\\npip install llama-index\\n\\nPut some documents in a folder called data, then ask questions about them with our famous 5-line starter:\\n\\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\\n\\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"data\").load_data()\\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\\nquery_engine = index.as_query_engine()\\nresponse = query_engine.query(\"Some question about the data should go here\")\\nprint(response)\\n\\nIf any part of this trips you up, don\\'t worry! Check out our more comprehensive starter tutorials using remote APIs like OpenAI or any model that runs on your laptop.\\n\\nLlamaCloud#\\n\\nIf you\\'re an enterprise developer, check out LlamaCloud. It is an end-to-end managed service for data parsing, ingestion, indexing, and retrieval, allowing you to get production-quality data for your production LLM application. It\\'s available both hosted on our servers or as a self-hosted solution.\\n\\nLlamaParse#\\n\\nLlamaParse is our state-of-the-art document parsing solution. It\\'s available as part of LlamaCloud and also available as a self-serve API. You can sign up and parse up to 1000 pages/day for free, or enter a credit card for unlimited parsing.
